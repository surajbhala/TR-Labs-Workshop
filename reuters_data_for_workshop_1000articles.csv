"March 18 (Reuters) - Hotel revenue slumped globally in February as the coronavirus outbreak across the world led to travel bans and canceled vacations, with Hong Kong taking the biggest hit, according to analytics firm STR. Data from STR, which runs a benchmarking platform for over 68,000 registered chains, groups and individual properties, showed revenue per available room (RevPAR) - a key metric for the industry - in Hong Kong fell 85.9% in February from a year earlier and 82.2% in mainland China. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong city had already been reeling under disruptions caused by intense clashes since pro-democracy protests escalated in June last year.

Most recently, Hyatt withdrew its 2020 earnings outlook, while the world's biggest hotel operator Marriott warned the outbreak could significantly hurt its full-year results. South Korea, Singapore and Thailand saw RevPAR fall between 30% and 47%, STR said. In the United States, San Francisco revenue fell 12%, while New York dropped 0.2% and Los Angeles 1.6%.

"(Adds details) LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - BT said Britain's decision to limit Huawei's role in building 5G and fibre networks would increase the cost of its gigabit-communications plan by about 500 million pounds ($657 million) over five years. Philip Jansen, chief executive of Britain's biggest broadband and mobile provider, said he welcomed the clarity around the use of vendors such as Huawei, a long-standing BT partner. ""(We) agree that the priority should be the security of the UK's communications infrastructure,"" he said in a third-quarter trading update on Thursday. ""We are in the process of reviewing the guidance in detail to determine the full impact on our plans and at this time estimate an impact of around 500 million pounds over the next 5 years.""

"* For more technical analyses, click SINGAPORE, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Spot gold is biased to break a support at $1,546 and fall towards $1,524 per ounce, as suggested by a projection analysis. The support is identified as the 138.2% projection level of an uptrend from $1,265.90. A big shooting star forming on Jan. 8 suggests a dissipation of the bullish momentum. Either a wave (5) from the Nov. 12 low of $1,445.18 has completed, or a deep correction is developing. Unless gold could break the immediate resistance at $1,568, it is likely to extend its loss towards $1,524. A retracement analysis on the downtrend from the 2011 high to the 2015 low of $1,045.85 reveals a strong resistance at $1,586, the 61.8% level. Apparently, gold failed to overcome this barrier. It is expected to hover below this level for one or two weeks. * Charts are not available in reports received in email box through ""Alert"".

"(Corrects paragraph 15 to say Kuwait Petroleum seeks LNG cargo,not offers) * Chinese demand still low due to ongoing celebrations * Temperatures to go above normal after brief dip - data * Outages fail to lift prices By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices forliquefied natural gas (LNG) continued their downward spiral thisweek, hitting a 17-month low as the market moved further awayfrom the peak winter demand period and inventories remained highin the region. Spot prices for March delivery to Asia <LNG-AS> fell to$6.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) this week, down20 cents from the previous week to their lowest since Sept. 8,2017, trade sources said. April prices are estimated at about $6.30 per mmBtu, thesources said. Demand in China remained tepid as many factories there werestill shut for Lunar New Year celebrations, trade sources said.The Lunar New Year fell on Feb. 5 and 6 this year, but thefestival typically lasts for about two weeks. While temperatures in Beijing and Shanghai dipped belownormal briefly, they are expected to get warmer next week,weather data from Refinitiv Eikon showed. ""It snowed in Beijing but it's not that cold still, plus thefactories are still shut, so the inventory levels are stillquite high,"" a China-based trade source said. Several unplanned outages failed to lift prices, indicatingjust how weak demand is currently, trade sources said. Loadings of LNG cargoes at Malaysia's Bintulu export plant,operated by Petronas, were delayed this week due to lowerproduction, sources have said. But the delay was due to minor glitches at the plant whichhave since been resolved, one of the sources said. Woodside Petroleum's Pluto LNG facility has also resumedfull output after a brief outage. With prices falling, there is also less incentive forproducers to keep output at high levels, an industry sourcesaid. Natural gas flows to U.S. LNG export terminals were expectedto increase in coming days after collapsing to their lowestlevel in almost a year as fog clears along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Analysts said the drop was due to maintenance work at theLNG terminals and pipelines feeding them, and fog, which hadforced several vessels to drop anchor in the Gulf of Mexico. At least one LNG cargo was delayed briefly from CheniereEnergy Inc's Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana, but loadingshave since resumed, a source familiar with the matter said. Supply remained ample in Asia with Indonesia's Donggi-SenoroLNG export plant offering a cargo for April, while KuwaitPetroleum Corp was seeking a cargo for March.

"By Will Boggs MD NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Incorporating two pathological features obtainable from biopsies could improve prediction of outcomes and guide treatment choices in men with prostate cancer, according to a new proof-of-principle study. Invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma (CR/IDC) are pathological features that independently predict disease-specific survival (DSS) and biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS), but they are not included in current grading systems. Dr. Geert J. L. H. van Leenders of Erasmus University Medical Center, in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and colleagues investigated whether incorporation of CR/IDC into the current Gleason score-based grade groups improved prediction of prostate cancer outcomes in their study of more than 1,000 men with prostate cancer who participated in the Dutch part of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. The new cribriform Grade (cGrade) is equal to the Gleason score-based Grade Group (GG) if CR/IDC is present and equal to the GG minus 1 if CR/IDC is absent (for GG2-5). For men with GG1, the cGrade is also 1, except in the rare case of GG1 with concomitant intraductal carcinoma, where the assigned cGrade is 2. Incorporation of CR/IDC in the cGrade had the most prominent effect in GG2 tumors, 82.6% of which were classified as cGrade1. DSS in these men was not significantly different from that of men with GG1 prostate cancer. Reclassification occurred in 42.3% of GG3, 48.4% of GG4 and 37.3% of GG5 cases, while only 0.8% (4/486) of patients with GG1 were upgraded to cGrade2 due to the presence of intra-ductal carcinoma, the researchers report in European Urology, online August 19. The cGrade had significantly higher discriminative value in predicting DSS than did GG (C-index, 0.79 vs. 0.76, p=0.029), nominally better discrimination for metastasis-free survival (MFS) (C-index, 0.79 vs. 0.77, P=0.062), and comparable discriminative value for BCRFS after radiation therapy (C-index, 0.71 vs. 0.72; P=0.2). The total number of men who fulfilled the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance criteria for active surveillance would increase from 272 (26.4%) to 356 (34.5%) if cGrade1 was used instead of GG1. ""The cGrade is a simple prostate cancer grade modification with better discriminative values for DSS and MFS than the GG, particularly impacting decision making in men with current GG2 prostate cancer,"" the researchers conclude. Dr. Jonathan Epstein from The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, in Baltimore, Maryland, who studies prostate cancer and its grading, told Reuters Health by email that ""very-low-grade prostate cancers (Grade Group 1 = Gleason score 3+3 = 6)"" often do not need treatment. ""Then there are overt higher-grade cancers (Grade Groups 3-5 = Gleason scores 4+3 = 7; 4+4 = 8; 9-10) which definitely need treatment,"" he added. ""However, there is a group of intermediate-grade cancers, (Grade Group 2 = Gleason score 3+4 = 7) of which some need treatment and some may not (depending on whether the patient is older, has co-morbidity, etc.), where pathologists are trying to find out factors on biopsy to tell the favorable Grade Group 2 versus the unfavorable."" ""This study is one such attempt. However, it won't be adopted in widespread practice currently as there are too many questions of how the study was done,"" he added. ""None of the results are surprising,"" Dr. Epstein said, ""in part because cribriform glands are considered together with intraductal carcinoma, which is a markedly adverse finding on prostate biopsy."" Dr. van Leenders did not respond to a request for comments.

"By Frank Pingue Dec 4 (Reuters) - Ushering in a winning culture to the U.S. national team, still reeling from their failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, will take time and patience, newly-appointed men's head coach Gregg Berhalter said on Tuesday. Berhalter, who was named U.S. coach on Sunday after a year-long search for a full-time boss, spoke about wanting to see his new squad accelerate in their development, but also stressed that there is no quick fix. ""As with any team building it's a process,"" Berhalter, 45, said at his introductory news conference in New York City. ""I don't want to use that as an excuse and say eight years from now we are going to be good. ""The process has to accelerate. And when you have quality players, when you have players that have the ability to learn you can accelerate that process a little bit. ""But what I'd say is that we want to see progress. Each and every camp you should expect to see development amongst the team. That's my job."" Berhalter, who was a defender for the U.S. at both the 2002 and 2006 World Cups, joins the national team after spending the last five years with Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew, a stint that included a run to the 2015 MLS Cup Final. He succeeds Dave Sarachan, who took over on an interim basis in October 2017 after the resignation of Bruce Arena, whose failure to steer the U.S. to the 2018 World Cup was considered by some to be the worst calamity in U.S. soccer history. Berhalter's first match as coach of the U.S. team will be on Jan. 27 against Panama in Glendale, Arizona, and he will no doubt be looking at that game as a way to show signs that things are on the right track. ""I am committed to working harder every day to build a team that the fans can be proud of,"" said Berhalter. ""There is nothing more that our country wants right now than to be proud of our U.S. national team and I am committed to making it happen."" Berhalter, one of one of 33 candidates for the coaching job, has a reputation as being a teacher with an almost obsessive attention to tactical detail. Berhalter said that it was hard to truly evaluate the team that played under Sarachan, a stretch that was very much considered a rebuilding year, but that he did recognise a group of quality players, albeit ones that need better direction. ""My job and the job of this staff is to work as hard as we can and give the players belief,"" said Berhalter.

"* Funds must be proportionate to expected results * Steel workers stage protests in Duisburg, Germany * Management will review strategy first, talk funds later (Adds further comment from the company, context) DUISBURG/FRANKFURT, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Ailing conglomerate Thyssenkrupp will review the business plan for its steel division in the coming weeks, it said on Tuesday, adding there was limited scope for additional funds in light of its stretched balance sheet. The remarks came as steel workers staged protests at the unit's headquarters in Duisburg in the heart of the Ruhr area, Germany's industrial heartland, asking for job security and future investments. The unit's future hangs in the balance after a deal to combine it with the European division of Tata Steel collapsed earlier this year.

"(Removes superfluous text in paragraph 5) By Kate Duguid and Jennifer Ablan NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, on Thursday said the United States is ""a big winner"" in the trade war with China ""in the short-term,"" but not necessarily over time. Fink, speaking at Yahoo Finance's second annual ""All Markets Summit,"" said the United States is currently the dominant force in the trade war because U.S. companies are benefiting from the strong dollar. That has driven U.S. stocks up, while equities have fallen elsewhere. In the long term, however, trade tensions will hurt the United States as they are leading more non-American companies to expand their business ties with China, Fink said. Still, Fink said he did not expect China's renminbi to become a global currency of choice anytime soon, even though U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist policies may benefit China in the long-term. Fink also said he is worried about U.S. unilateralism. ""The world is probably economically less safe."" BlackRock's $6.3 trillion assets under management make the New York-based firm one of the most influential voices on investing worldwide. Fink was the first speaker at the event, addressing a group that included investors and executives. Fink also said that for U.S. companies to be successful in coming years, they must consider their position on social and political issues. Millennial consumers and employees want to associate with brands that they believe in, he said. Companies like Nike Inc, which recently launched an ad campaign featuring football player and black activist Colin Kaepernick, Fink said, are succeeding on that front. ""More people want to associate themselves with a brand that they believe in,"" Fink said. ""Employees are more interested in working for a company that they believe in,"" he added. As for the short term, Fink said that despite trade concerns and political instability around the world, U.S. stocks would likely continue their strong performance. “I’m not really concerned about whether we’ll see a setback. The markets have rallied since 2009,” he said. “If you look at the markets today, we see a huge increase in corporate earnings on the back of tax cuts and a rising economy.” Fink also observed that even as stock prices have risen, valuations have become more attractive for investors. “[The price/earnings multiple] is lower today than it was a year ago, so the marketplace is now discounting some of those worries,” he said. “Some people may think they’re discounting enough, but with P/E down, you could say the market is less expensive.” (Reporting By Jennifer Ablan and Kate Duguid; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Dan Grebler)",REFILE-UPDATE 3-BlackRock's Fink: U.S. a short-term 'big winner' in China trade war," larry fink, chief executive of blackrock, said the united states is a big winner in the trade war with china in the short-term. in the long-term, trade tensions will hurt the united states as they are leading more non-american companies to expand their business ties with china. fink also said he is worried about u.s . unilateralism .

"* Salvini says has no intention to ""blow up"" state accounts * Italian bond yields hit lowest level in almost a month * Di Maio denies wanting to ""destroy Europe"" (Adds comments from Di Maio, business lobby, market reaction) By Giuseppe Fonte and Angelo Amante ROME, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Italy's top ministers issued a barrage of statements on Wednesday to reassure financial markets over the government's forthcoming budget, promising to keep state accounts in check and maintain economic stability. The concerted charm campaign helped push Italian bond yields to their lowest in almost a month, as hopes grew that the coalition, comprising the rightist League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, would respect European Union budget discipline . ""Clearly we will not do everything in one shot, not even Italians expect that from us ... If we want to run the country for a long period we cannot blow up its public accounts,"" Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini told the newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore. Investors have sold off Italian bonds since the government took office in June, on concern that the coalition may implement policies that would increase the country's already-huge debt and breach EU fiscal rules. But after a summer filled with promises of imminent radical action, ministers have changed their tune this week, following credit ratings agency Fitch's decision cut its outlook for Italian debt -- the third largest in the world.. League leader Salvini met his fellow deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday to discuss the 2019 budget, which has to be issued by mid-October and which will be the government's first major legislation. ""The budget law will be courageous and will keep accounts in order,"" Di Maio, who is also the 5-Star leader, told reporters afterwards. ""Here, we have people saying we want to wreck the accounts and destroy Europe."" BUSINESS LOBBY RELIEVED He said the package would include key campaign promises, such as introducing a so-called ""universal income"" for the unemployed, watering down a 2011 pension reform and tax cuts. However, he echoed Salvini by saying the coalition planned to govern over the long term, suggesting policies would be implemented gradually. Salvini told Il Sole that priority would be given to rolling back the unpopular pension reform that raised the minimum retirement age. He added that tax cuts would be implemented gradually and would initially favour small businesses. Italy's business lobby Confindustria welcomed his comments. ""It seems that deputy prime minister Salvini's words show a move towards great responsibility,"" said Confindustria chief Vincenzo Boccia. The coalition is due to deliver Italy's latest economic growth and public finance targets at the end of the month, before the full budget. Under EU rules, no country should have a budget deficit greater than 3 percent of GDP product or debt above 60 percent of GDP. Italy's debt amounts to more than 130 percent, the second highest in Europe after Greece, making it vulnerable to market pressure. Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, an academic who is not a member of either of the governing parties, is pushing to keep next year's deficit below 2 percent of GDP, sources said on Monday. A League source said on Tuesday that Salvini wanted the government to accept a deficit ""a bit above"" 2 percent. Di Maio said the issue was not broached on Wednesday. A fresh budget meeting was called for Thursday.

"* Italy frustrated by pace of Egyptian investigation * Egypt has always denied any involvement in Regeni death * The five suspects are members of National Security Agency (Adds further comment from Egypt, background) By Domenico Lusi ROME, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors have placed five members of Egypt's security forces under official investigation for their alleged involvement in the disappearance of student Giulio Regeni, a judicial source said. Regeni, a 28-year-old postgraduate student at Cambridge University, vanished in Cairo in January 2016. His body was found almost a week later and a post mortem examination showed he had been tortured before his death. There was no immediate comment from authorities in Egypt. Egyptian officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in Regeni's killing. The five suspects are all members of the National Security Agency and include a general, two colonels and a major, the source said. They have been placed under investigation for allegedly kidnapping Regeni. No one has yet been named in connection with the killing itself. Under Italian law, being placed under official investigation does not imply guilt and does not automatically lead to a trial. Regeni disappeared on Jan. 25, 2016 - the fifth anniversary of the start of the 2011 uprising that ended the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak. Intelligence and security sources told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-regeni-exclusive-idUSKCN0XI1YU in 2016 that police had arrested Regeni outside a Cairo metro station and then transferred him to a compound run by Homeland Security. Italian and Egyptian investigators have been working together to try to solve the crime and have held regular meetings in Rome and Cairo to pool their information. SENSITIVE STUDIES However judicial sources in Rome told Reuters last week that Italy was frustrated by the slow pace of developments in Egypt and had decided to press ahead with its own line of enquiry in an effort to move things forward. Egypt's state information service said on Monday that Italy had sought Egypt's approval for listing ""a number of Egyptian policemen"" as suspects during a meeting of the prosecutors from the two countries last week. It said such a request had already been rejected in the past because Egyptian law did not recognise the procedure for placing suspects under investigation before possible charges are laid. It also cited a lack of solid evidence for the request, which, it said, was ""merely based upon initial police inquiries"". The judicial sources in Rome said that amongst those placed under investigation on Tuesday was a colonel who had met Italian prosecutors during their first visit to Cairo in February 2016. He had assured them that local security forces had had nothing to do with the disappearance of Regeni, the same judicial sources said. Regeni had been researching https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/egypt-regeni Egypt’s independent unions for his doctoral thesis. Associates say he was also interested in alternatives to the long-standing domination of Egypt’s economy by the state and the military. Both subjects are sensitive in Egypt. The military’s grip on the economy is a subject rarely talked about in a country that has been ruled almost entirely by military men since the overthrow of King Farouk in 1952.

"JOHANNESBURG, Sept 27 (Reuters) - South Africa has signed an extradition treaty with the United Arab Emirates, the justice minister said on Thursday, raising the prospect of the Gupta brothers, friends of former president Jacob Zuma, returning to face corruption charges. The Indian-born brothers - Ajay, Atul and Rajesh - have been accused of using their ties with Zuma to siphon off billions of rand in state funds and of inappropriately influencing cabinet appointments. The Guptas are believed to be in Dubai where they own property and businesses and police have issued an arrest warrant for Ajay Gupta over a corruption case. The Guptas and Zuma, who have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment. Justice Minister Michael Masutha told Reuters that treaties on extradition and legal assistance had been signed with his counterpart Sultan Saeed Al Badi on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi. ""I will not at this stage comment on individual matters,"" Masutha said when asked about the Guptas. A long-awaited inquiry into allegations of inappropriately influencing government decisions, known locally as ""state capture"", opened last month with witnesses testifying that the Gupta brothers tried to bribe or threaten them. The Guptas left South Africa earlier this year around the time Zuma resigned under pressure from his own party. Activists, opposition politicians and members of the ruling African National Congress have been calling for an extradition treaty to be agreed with the UAE so the Gupta brothers can be ordered to return to South Africa.

"(Fixes typo in para 12.) By Marilynn Larkin NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Kidney transplantation isassociated with a survival benefit for patients with lupusnephritis and end-stage renal disease (LN-ESRD), researchershave found. Patients with LN-ESRD have high mortality rates, Dr. AprilJorge of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston noted in anemail to Reuters Health. ""We found that among nearly all such patients in the UnitedStates who were waitlisted, renal transplant was associated witha significant survival benefit,"" she said. ""This is anencouraging finding, and clinicians should consider earlyreferral for renal transplantation for patients with LN-ESRD whomay be candidates, as this can reduce mortality."" Dr. Jorge and colleagues studied 9,659 patients with LN-ESRDon dialysis who were waitlisted for transplant between 1995 and2015, including 5,738 (59%) who ultimately received a newkidney. The average age at waitlist entry was 38 and at transplant,39. Eighty-two percent of waitlisted patients were female, 48%were African American and 21% were Hispanic. Hypertension wasthe most common comorbidity, affecting 79% of waitlistedpatients. As reported online January 21 in Annals of InternalMedicine, 973 transplant recipients died during follow-up, asdid 1,697 patients who did not receive a transplant. Mortalityrates were 22.5 and 56.3 per 1,000 person-years, respectively(hazard ratio, 0.29). After adjustment, renal transplant was associated with a 70%reduction in risk for death (adjusted HR, 0.30). The lower riskfor all-cause mortality was similar across racial groups andpersisted across other characteristics - e.g., age at ESRDonset, sex, year of ESRD onset). After accounting for competing risks, renal transplant wasassociated with a 74% lower risk for cardiovascular death (aHR,0.26). Specifically, patients who underwent a transplant had a70% lower risk for death due to coronary heart disease (aHR,0.30) and a 61% lower risk for death due to stroke (aHR, 0.39). The risk of death due to infection or sepsis was also lowerin transplant recipients than among those who remainedwaitlisted (aHR, 0.41 for each). A secondary analysis included 2,963 patients who had atransplant and 2,963 matched comparators. During follow-up, 470patients with and 608 without a transplant died, resulting inmortality rates of 21.1 and 77.1 per 1,000 person-years,respectively (HR, 0.24). Dr. Jorge noted, ""As organ transplants are a limitedresource, access to transplantation is likely to be a limitingfactor for broadening implementation of this intervention."" ""Furthermore,"" she added, ""this study did not addressfactors that may impact transplant eligibility, such as lupusactivity or other organ damage from systemic lupuserythematosus."" Dr. Nitender Goyal of Tufts Medical Center in Boston,coauthor of an accompanying editorial, told Reuters Health byemail, ""Kidney transplant is the best treatment for (LN-ESRD)patients and provides both survival and quality of lifebenefits. Outcomes are superior when kidney transplant isperformed prior to initiation of dialysis when compared with anextended period of dialysis."" ""Unfortunately,"" he said, ""a small percentage of patientswith LN-ESRD receive a kidney transplant before needing dialysisfor many reasons, including organ shortage leading to long waittime, low living donation rate and a concern about recurrence ofdisease in the transplanted kidney."" ""There is unmet need for development of better treatment forpatients with LN to prevent progression of disease and maintainkidney health,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, kidney transplantationremains the best (option)."" ""Timely transplantation can be achieved by discussing kidneytransplantation early in the course of disease so that enoughresources can be dedicated to identifying a suitable livingdonor and barriers to transplantation,"" he said.

"(Repeats Aug. 18 story to additional clients) By Nuzulack Dausen DAR ES SALAAM, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The U.S.-China trade warand uncertainty over Brexit pose risks to Africa's economicprospects that are ""increasing by the day,"" the head of theAfrican Development Bank (AfDB) told Reuters. The trade dispute between the world's two largest economieshas roiled global markets and unnerved investors as it stretchesinto its second year with no end in sight. Britain, meanwhile, appears to be on course to leave theEuropean Union on Oct. 31 without a transition deal, whicheconomists fear could severely disrupt trade flows.

All 10 economists polled by Reuters had expected no move. Yaron was sworn in on Dec. 24 and replaces Karnit Flug,whose term ended in mid-November. At the subsequent meeting onNov. 26, under deputy governor Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg,policymakers raised the benchmark interest rate to0.25 percent from 0.1 percent in a surprise move. Speaking to reporters after the decision to hold rates thistime, Yaron said ""the rising path of the interest rate in thefuture will be gradual and cautious"". Modi Shafrir, chief strategist at Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank'sfinance division, called both the statement and Yaron's comments""dovish"". In an updated forecast, the central bank's own economistsexpect the key rate to remain on hold for the first half of 2019and rise once in the third quarter to end the year at 0.50percent. They foresee another hike in the first quarter of 2020and a rate of 1.25 percent by the end of next year, with aninflation rate of 1.3 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2020. ""If these forecasts are realised, they will be consistentwith gradual contraction of the monetary policy accommodation,""Yaron said. In keeping rates steady, the Bank of Israel said data showedthe economy was performing well and the labour market was tight,with economic weakness in the second and third quarters due toone-time factors. The bank believes continued wage increases will help pushinflation higher. Israel's economy grew an estimated 3.2 percent in 2018 --below a 3.7 percent forecast -- and the Bank of Israel expects a3.4 percent rate this year, down from a previous estimate of 3.6percent.

"* Liquidity crisis to be solved by early 2019 - deputy PM * State oil firm to get $1.8 bln development funds in 2019 * Restoring liquidity could crimp armed groups' funds By Aidan Lewis and Ulf Laessing TRIPOLI, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Libya expects to end a long-running liquidity crisis by early 2019 as a foreign currency tax helps the official and black market exchange rates converge at less than 3 dinars to the dollar, the Tripoli-based deputy prime minister said. The chasm between the two rates has enabled armed groups and their allies to reap vast profits to fund the conflict that has engulfed Libya since 2011, when a NATO-backed uprising overthrew Muammar Gaddafi after more than four decades in power. Meanwhile ordinary Libyans, reliant on imports of everything from milk to cars, have seen living standards crumble. Since 2014, Libya has had competing governments aligned with rival armed factions based in the capital Tripoli and the east. The internationally recognised Tripoli government hopes its currency reforms will help restore confidence in the economy and chart a way out of the turmoil by putting the armed groups out of business, a main goal of U.N. efforts to stabilise Libya. Asked when the liquidity situation in the banks would be normalised, Ahmed Maiteeg told Reuters: ""By the beginning of February, beginning of next year, it will be part of the past."" Once the rates converge and the supply of dinars and dollars is freed up, Libya will begin reducing fuel subsidies that cost the state up to $5 billion last year and have led to rampant smuggling to neighbouring countries, Maiteeg said. He also said state oil firm NOC, which has struggled to maintain oil fields amid funding shortages and blockages by armed groups, would get a development budget of $1.8 billion in 2019, as the wheels of the economy start turning with the flow of dollars. Other development projects would also be restarted. Between 2014 and 2017, the dinar fell by as much as 600 percent on the parallel black market, which has become the widely used benchmark, as oil production see-sawed and trust in the banking system collapsed. The official rate, used only by some state companies, has remained at 1.4 dinars. To bridge the gap, the internationally recognised government in Tripoli slapped a 183 percent tax on commercial and private hard currency deals in September, bringing the effective official rate for such transactions to 3.9 dinars. Together with a new allowance that allows Libyans to withdraw up to $10,000 annually using a credit card, this has helped bring down the parallel rate to 5.30 from between 6 and 7 two months ago, according to dealers' rates seen by Reuters. BREAK EVEN The government expects the black market rate to continue to fall as dollars continue to pour in from the card allowance and as more import letters of credit are opened. Spelling out details of the reforms for the first time, Maiteeg said Libya would nudge the effective official rate lower as the black market rate dropped. ""It will go down gradually until it reaches the break even or the right exchange rate,"" he said. Libya used a similar mechanism to devalue its currency in the 1990s. Maiteeg declined to give the future official rate, saying only that studies put a fair value at between 2 and 2.4 dinars. ""Much depends on oil exports and actual internal demand."" When pressed whether the official rate would at least be less than 3 he said: ""Of course."" After access to cash improves, the government will gradually draw down a fuel subsidy that has long been among the most generous in the world. A litre of petrol costs 0.15 dinars. However, previous governments have tried to reform the subsidies but have faced resistance from the armed groups for whom smuggling has become a lucrative source of income - suggesting the militia will not roll over easily. The groups have also made vast profits through their control over banks and through scams linked to letters of credit (LCs)that grant dollars at the official exchange rate. Maiteeg said letters that had been restricted due to falling dollar revenues and the import scams were now freely available at the 3.9 rate, and credit worth more than $1 billion was issued from Oct. 1-24. ""It is open for everybody now so there is no need to have a militia, or pressure the central bank to have an LC. Anyone who wants an LC at 3.9 just apply and you will have it,"" he said. The expected $1.8 billion in 2019 for oil firm NOC will boost production, Maiteeg said. ""This will improve the production of oil and this will improve the NOC pipelines."" NOC and state power firm GECOL are exempt from the new foreign currency fee, while other state firms have to apply for exemptions. Maiteeg said that so far no foreign reserves had been spent on LCs, but the government was willing to spend them if necessary. Restarting more than 4,800 projects halted since 2011 will help create jobs, Maiteeg said. ""Many of these projects will be started in 2019,"" he said.

"By Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart WASHINGTON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration is considering giving U.S. troops on the border with Mexico the authority to carry out medical screening of migrants, U.S. officials told Reuters on Tuesday. The proposal, which is still in draft form and is circulating within the administration, would involve the military in screenings for things like illness and injury only if U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency personnel were overwhelmed and unable to do so on their own, the officials said. The proposal would expand the mission for the Pentagon, which said previously it did not expect its forces to directly interact with migrants. The Pentagon declined to comment. U.S. military duties on the border, including stringing up concertina wire and building temporary housing, have been aimed at supporting CBP personnel. The U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters about the proposal did so on condition of anonymity because Trump has not yet signed off on the idea. It was unclear if the proposal, if confirmed in the coming days, might prolong the deployment of at least some troops at the border. The commander of the mission told Reuters last week that the number of troops may have peaked at around 5,800, and he would soon look at whether to begin sending forces home or shifting some to new border positions.

"* Iron ore imports 1.069 bln T vs 1.064 bln T in 2018 * Dec imports 101.3 mln T vs 90.65 mln T Nov * Steel products exports at 64.29 mln T in 2019 * Shipments from big miners seen increasing in 2020 - analysts (Adds steel trade data, graphics) By Min Zhang and Tom Daly BEIJING, Jan 14 (Reuters) - China's iron ore imports rose 0.47% in 2019 to hover just below their all-time annual peak, fuelled by strong demand at steel mills and a second-half recovery in shipments from big miners after disruptions earlier in the year. The world's top steel producer brought in 1.069 billion tonnes of iron ore in 2019, rising from 1.064 billion tonnes a year earlier, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Tuesday. The record remains 2017's 1.075 billion tonnes. In December, purchases of the steelmaking ingredient surged 11.8% from a month earlier to 101.3 million tonnes, the data showed - the highest monthly import level in 27 months. The jump in iron ore imports came despite shipments from big miners being cut in the first half of 2019, when a tailings dam collapsed at a Brazilian mine while a tropical cyclone hit miners in west Australia. ""Purchases from non-mainstream suppliers increased amid soaring iron ore prices,"" said Wu Shiping, analyst with Tianfeng Futures, noting smaller mines in Brazil and Australia and countries including South Africa and India increased shipments. Prices for benchmark iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange soared almost 140% in 2019, squeezing profit margins at mills across China that were already hurt by slowing economic growth and a bruising trade war with the United States. INFRASTRUCTURE DEMAND Beijing's move to beef up stimulus projects to avoid a sharper economic slowdown led to robust demand from a resilient property market and the infrastructure sector, helping to boost iron ore imports. ""Many construction activities will even last till the Lunar New Year eve,"" Tianfeng's Wu said, referring to the traditional week-long holiday season that is set to bring a broad industry closedown from Jan. 24 this year. Utilisation rates at 247 mills across China stood at 77.6% last week, data tracked by Mysteel consultancy showed. With Brazil's Vale SA resuming operations at some mines and other big miners increasing production, analysts and market participants expect a rise in overall iron ore supply this year. China's steel product exports recovered from November to 4.68 million tonnes, but were still well below 5.56 million tonnes in the same period last year. Full-year exports came in at 64.29 million tonnes, down 7.3% from a year earlier. Steel exports have cooled since the second half of 2019, hit by Beijing's efforts to cut overcapacity, along with slower global demand and trade frictions.

The revision of the Outlook reflects Fitch's view that risks to the bank's credit profile from operating environment and asset quality pressures should be manageable given its level of capital, profitability and liquidity buffers.

We expect asset quality trends at the bank to stabilise - notwithstanding operating environment risks - given the short-term duration of its lending and the origination of new loans against the backdrop of the stronger, albeit below-trend, economic growth environment and relatively more stable market conditions. We consider short-term operating environment risks to have partly abated given Turkey's progress in stabilising its economy. Fitch forecasts GDP of 3.1% in 2020 up from 0.1% in 2019. Key Rating Drivers IDRS AND VIABILITY RATING (VR) Anadolubank's Long-Term IDRs are driven by its standalone creditworthiness, as reflected in its 'b+' VR. The bank's VR reflects its small absolute size, limited franchise (end-9M19: 0.4% of sector assets) and concentration of its operations in the challenging and volatile Turkish operating environment, which expose it to market volatility and political and geopolitical uncertainty. This is balanced by the bank's record of solid performance through the cycle - partly reflecting the shorter-term and more flexible nature of its balance sheet and operations - and low foreign currency wholesale funding exposure. In addition, capital and liquidity buffers are adequate for the bank's risk profile. Anadolubank is focused on the fairly risky SME and commercial segment (a combined 56% of net loans), which is highly sensitive to macro risks, and corporate borrowers (41%). However, its company profile is underpinned by flexibility in its business model, facilitated by its primarily short-term, local-currency lending strategy. The bank maintains a high share of short-term floating-rate assets, which enables swift balance sheet adjustments in response to changing market conditions and prevents margin erosion through rapid loan repricing. This has supported its sound track record of performance and ability to replenish capital buffers organically amid challenging market conditions. Nevertheless, asset quality weakened in 2018-9M19, reflecting pressures on the bank's SME and commercial portfolios in deteriorating operating environment conditions but also rapid loan seasoning effects, given the short-term tenor of lending. At end-9M19 a high 83% of Anadolubank's loan book had an outstanding maturity below one year. The impaired loans ratio rose to a high 8.4% at end-9M19 (sector: 5.0%) while NPL origination and generation rates remained elevated (6.1% and 4.4%, respectively; annualised). In addition, the bank reported fairly high - albeit decreasing - Stage 2 loans (9.7% of gross loans), over half of which were restructured, and these could migrate to Stage 3 as loans season. Credit risks at the bank remain significant due to high, although below the sector average, foreign currency lending (end-3Q19: 23% of gross loans), given the potential impact of local currency depreciation on often weakly hedged borrowers' ability to service their debt, and exposure to the troubled real estate and construction (end-3Q19: a combined 13% of gross loans) and agro (7%) sectors. However, single-name concentration relative to capital is low and below peers. In 9M19, loan growth also largely related to exposures to good quality financial institution groups (12% of gross loans) - albeit such lending does not form part of the bank's core lending strategy. Nevertheless, short-term macroeconomic risks have partly abated, given Turkey's progress in rebalancing and stabilising the economy. The stronger GDP growth outlook (2020: 3.1% GDP growth forecast), the lower local currency interest rate environment and greater lira stability should mitigate downside risks to asset quality to some extent, as for the sector. Anadolubank continued to report strong, above sector-average profitability in 9M19 (operating profit/risk-weighted assets of 2.8%; sector: 1.8%), reflecting its healthy net interest margin (9M19: 6.2%) which is supported by its ability to swiftly reprice loans. The bank's profitability also reflects a lower level of impairments (31% of pre-impairment operating profit) than peers. However, the bank's performance could weaken in 2020 with margin pressure (given limited pricing power) and higher impairments as problem loans gradually feed through. Capitalisation is adequate (end-9M19: Fitch Core Capital ratio of 14.3%) for the bank's risk profile and level of internal capital generation. The bank's CET 1 ratio (14.5%) was higher than peers and all capital ratios were comfortably above regulatory minimum requirements at end-9M19. The bank is able to manage its capital position through rapid deleveraging, if needed, given the short-term nature of its balance sheet. Pre-impairment profit (9M19: equal to 5.4% of average loans; annualised) provides a solid buffer to absorb losses through the income statement. The bank is largely funded by granular customer deposits (end-3Q19: a high 91% of total funding) and wholesale funding is limited, mitigating refinancing risks. The loans/customer deposits ratio is reasonable at about 100% and deposit concentration is low. The share of foreign currency deposits in total deposits has been broadly stable (end-9M19: 44%; 36% unconsolidated basis) and below sector-average (52%). Deposits held at Anadolubank NV represented 14% of total deposits (or 30% of FC deposits) at end-9M19 and their average tenor (about one year) is longer term than at the bank's Turkish operations. Wholesale funding amounted to a low 9% of total funding at end-9M19. About half is in foreign currency and largely short term. It consists mainly of money market, repo and bilateral funding (including trade finance) from Anadolubank NV. Refinancing risk is manageable given low external debt exposure. At end-9M19, FC liquidity comfortably covered short-term non-deposit foreign currency liabilities falling due within a year. It comprises mainly interbank assets, mandatory reserves held against local currency liabilities under the Reserve Option Mechanism and cash. Nevertheless, foreign currency liquidity could come under pressure in case of large foreign currency deposit outflows. NATIONAL RATING The affirmation of Anadolubank's National Rating reflects our view that the bank's creditworthiness in local currency relative to other Turkish issuers has not changed. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The '5' Support Rating and 'No Floor' Support Rating Floor reflect Fitch's view that support cannot be relied upon from the Turkish authorities, due to the bank's small size and limited systemic importance, nor from shareholders. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VR AND NATIONAL RATING The bank's ratings could be downgraded due to i) a marked deterioration in the operating environment, as reflected in adverse changes to the lira exchange rate, domestic interest rates, economic growth prospects, and external funding market access; ii) a weakening of the bank's foreign currency liquidity position, most likely due to deposit outflows; or iii) a greater than expected pressure in asset quality and profitability or high loan growth that puts pressure on the bank's capital position. Upside for the ratings is limited in the near term, given still heightened operating environment risks and ensuing pressure on the bank's standalone credit profile and the bank's nominal franchise. Anadolubank's National Rating is sensitive to a change in the entity's creditworthiness relative to other rated Turkish issuers. Summary of Financial Adjustments An adjustment has been made in Fitch's financial spreadsheets of the Anadolubank that has impacted core and complimentary metrics. Fitch have taken a loan that was classified as a financial asset measured at fair value through profit and loss in the bank's financial statements and reclassified it under gross loans as we believe this is the most appropriate line in Fitch spreadsheets to reflect this exposure.

"* New code aims to end ""boilerplate"" criticisms * New annual scorecard from January 2021 (Adds more reaction) By Huw Jones LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Asset managers in Britain face tougher checks on how they hold companies and other assets they invest in to account, and must for the first time consider environmental, social and governance factors like climate change. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) published what it called a fundamentally strengthened Stewardship Code on Thursday which reflects greater demand from investors to invest in more ""sustainable"" assets that don't harm the environment. The existing, nine-year old code simply asks funds to outline their investment policies. The revised code requires a more detailed, yearly submission to the FRC for the first time to not only set out what steps asset managers took to engage with the assets they invest in, but the outcomes as well. ""The FRC will be holding signatories to account by regular review of adoption of the new code and the quality of the reporting against its principles,"" said FRC Chief Executive Jon Thompson. A government-backed review last year that recommended replacing the FRC with a more powerful watchdog, said the ""ineffective"" current code should be beefed up. ""If this cannot be achieved, and the code remains simply a driver of boilerplate reporting, serious consideration should be given to its abolition,"" the review said. Kingman said that while he fully supports the new code, the ""proof is in the pudding"", meaning it needs to deliver in practice. Martin Webster, a partner at Pinsent Masons lawfirm, said it was questionable whether the new code would remove ""boilerplate"" reporting. ""And, with at least half the value of the UK stock market held by overseas investors, it is unclear how much notice they will take of these new, more onerous, but still voluntary provisions,"" Webster said. For the first time the revised code will apply to advisers of asset managers, pension funds, insurers, private equity, fixed income, infrastructure, and investments outside Britain. ""The most significant change will come from the new reporting requirements, enabling investment managers to demonstrate the tangible change their engagement with companies can bring and allowing savers and investors to judge the outcomes they deliver on their behalf,"" said the Investment Association, an asset management industry body. Signatories will have to show what checks were made by internal auditors and outside parties on their efforts to meet the code. The Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors said its members will need to ""step up"" on how they provide assurance. Around 300 asset managers are signed up to the existing code. The revised code comes into force in January, giving industry a year to prepare before making their first submission in early 2021 on compliance. The FRC will scrutinise the submissions and decide if firms can remain signatories, a de facto requirement for winning investment mandates in some cases. The watchdog will publish the names of firms that meet the standards of the new code so that investors can compare them with current signatories. The FRC published proposals earlier this year for revising its stewardship code, and the final version has been shortened to improve clarity.

"(Adds detail, quotes) By Kylie MacLellan LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - British foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday he understood why the United States had killed a top Iranian military commander but urged a de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East to avoid war in the region. Iran condemned Donald Trump as a ""terrorist in a suit"" after the U.S. president threatened to hit 52 Iranian sites if Tehran attacks Americans or U.S. assets in retaliation for the killing of Qassem Soleimani on Friday. Raab, who is due to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Thursday, said he had spoken to Iraq's prime minister and president and also planned to speak to Iran's foreign minister later on Sunday. ""We want to de-escalate the tensions, we want to see a route through this crisis. We do not want to see a major war in the Middle East.

Raab said Soleimani was a ""regional menace"" and he understood ""the position the Americans found themselves in"". Asked if the killing was legal, Raab said: ""It was General Soleimani’s job description to engage proxies and militias ... to attack Western countries that were legitimately there and in those circumstances the right of self defence clearly applies."" Raab said Britain, which on Saturday warned its citizens against travel to Iraq and Iran, was taking ""every essential measure"" to reduce the risk to British nationals, diplomatic missions and military personnel. He said the leadership in Tehran needed to know that there was a diplomatic way out. ""There is a route through which allows Iran to come in from out of the international cold,"" he told Sky News. ""We need to contain the nefarious actions of Iran but we also need to deescalate and stabilise the situation.""

"(Adds background) April 3 (Reuters) - Canada's biggest banks have received nearly half a million requests from homeowners to hold off mortgage payments as the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic deepens, according to the Canadian Bankers' Association. Since the banks announced a plan to provide financial relief over two weeks ago, almost 500,000 requests to skip or defer mortgage payments have been completed or are being processed, up from 213,000 on March 26, according to a statement https://cba.ca/mortgage-deferrals-in-canada-reach-half-a-million from the association. The delay in mortgage payments comes at a time when Canadian banks are seeing subdued earnings growth due to lower margins, increasing loan loss provisions and volatile performance in their capital markets divisions. The ""big six"" lenders - Royal Bank of Canada, TD Bank, Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal, CIBC and National Bank of Canada - announced the coordinated effort on March 17 to offer mortgage relief to customers suffering pay disruption as businesses grind to a halt. While homeowners can ask for up to a six-month deferral, it could cost them additional interest. ""The country's six largest banks have deferred more than 10% of the mortgages in their portfolio,"" the statement said. Cash freed up for Canadians from deferrals completed so far is about $663 million per month, or nearly $2 billion per quarter, and this number will increase over the coming weeks, the association said. A surge in deferrals usually points to a short-term liquidity crunch for lenders, but bigger banks are better-positioned to weather such a spike. To meet demand for deferrals and loans, Canada's biggest banks can access government liquidity support, including security purchases and also draw down from capital buffers. On Thursday, Toronto-Dominion Bank Chief Executive Officer Bharat Masrani said the bank has approved 60,000 or ""virtually all"" the requests for mortgage deferrals received so far as part of efforts to ease the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on borrowers.

"By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - Environmental factors appear to play abigger role than genetics in shaping children's risk forcavities, a study of Australian twins suggests. Researchers followed 345 twins from 24 weeks' gestationthrough six years of age, when they all had dental checkups. Atage six, 32 percent of the kids had tooth decay and 24 percentof the children had advanced cavities. To see how much genetics might shape the risk of cavities,researchers looked at how often both kids got cavities in pairsof identical twins - who have identical genetic variations - andfraternal twins - who typically share about half of theirvariations. The risk of both siblings developing any form of tooth decayor advanced cavities was similar for identical and fraternalpairs, suggesting that genetics doesn't explain much of the riskfor these oral health problems. ""Therefore, risk factors seem to be mostly environmental andare potentially modifiable,"" said lead study author Mihiri Silvaof the University of Melbourne and the Murdoch Children'sResearch Institute at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. ""This might debunk the idea that individuals are geneticallydestined to have poor teeth and should drive us to find ways ofaddressing the risk factors that we know are important fordental health,"" Silva said by email. Worldwide, an estimated 60 to 90 percent of school agechildren have tooth decay, potentially resulting in pain,infection and hospitalization, researchers note in Pediatrics.Toothache can also result in school absence, poor nutrition,compromised growth and development, and impaired quality of lifefor children and parents alike. Childhood cavities are also the strongest predictor of poororal health in adulthood, the study team writes. While some previous research has called into question therole genetics may play in causing cavities, research to datehasn't offered a clear picture of what role environmental orlifestyle factors might play in this risk. In the current study, both twins had cavities in 29 pairs;in another 33 pairs of twins, just one child was affected. Both kids had advanced cavities in 26 pairs of twins, andanother 31 pairs had just one child with advanced cavities. Three environmental factors in particular appeared to impactthe risk of cavities: maternal obesity, defects in tooth enamelmineralization, and lack of community water fluoridation. The study wasn't a controlled experiment designed to provewhether or how any of these factors might directly cause toothdecay or cavities. But it's possible maternal obesity might influence kids'risk of oral health problems due to shared dietary or lifestylehabits in the household or biological processes that influencesusceptibility to dental problems, Silva said. Obese mothers,for example, might be more likely to feed kids unhealthy foodthat can contribute to cavities. Fluoridation of drinking water, meanwhile, has been provento reduce the risk of cavities but isn't universally availablein public drinking water. And defects in tooth enamel mineralization that lead to weakenamel that can easily break down and form cavities may startdeveloping in the womb and early childhood. This may be causedby certain medications taken by women during pregnancy or bychildren early in life, as well as by poor nutrition and certaindiseases in early childhood. The good news is environmental factors like this can becontrolled to help improve oral health. ""Based on the findings from all the existing research -including ours - parents and families should focus on practicinghealthy habits in general including a diet low in sugar andregular toothbrushing,"" Silva advised. Defects in enamel ""can be detected and treated early toreduce problems, so ensuring children have early dentalcheck-ups starting at one year of age can minimize problemslater,"" Silva added.

"By Reuters Staff (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Monday it made a $1 billion deal with the U.S. government to create enough manufacturing capacity for more than 1 billion doses of a vaccine it is testing to fight the new coronavirus that has killed more than 34,000 people around the world. Johnson and Johnson said that it had selected its own lead vaccine candidate and would start human testing of its experimental coronavirus vaccine by September, with an eye on having it ready for emergency use in early 2021, the drugmaker said on Monday. J&J said that the first batches of a vaccine could be available under an emergency use authorization in early 2021, far quicker than the typical 18 month period that it takes for vaccines to be tested, approved and then manufactured. J&J also committed more than $1 billion of investment along with U.S. agency Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to co-fund vaccine research, expanding a previous collaboration. The new coronavirus, which emerged in Wuhan, China, has infected people in most countries around the world. The United States now has the most confirmed cases globally and many of them are in New York, where hospitals are reporting a scarcity of resources to treat the COVID-19 respiratory disease it causes. A patient was dosed with Moderna Inc's vaccine in an early-stage trial earlier this month, making it the front-runner in the race to develop a viable vaccine. J&J said in January it had begun working on a possible vaccine for the coronavirus, using the same technologies used to make its experimental Ebola vaccine.","J&J, U.S. government plan 1 billion doses of coronavirus vaccine", johnson &  johnson said on monday it made a $ 1 billion deal with the u.s . government to create enough manufacturing capacity for more than 1 billion doses of a vaccine it is testing to fight the new coronavirus. j&j said that the first batches of a vaccine could be available under an emergency use authorization in early 2021.,j&j makes $ 1 bln deal with u.s . government to make 1 billion doses of coronavirus vaccine

"BERLIN, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Angela Merkel's government said on Wednesday it would restrict tenders for the procurement of sensitive weapon systems to German companies, a protectionist measure by a chancellor who has come out strongly against such barriers. In a strategy paper that takes effect immediately, the government said it would extend the remit of existing rules to include naval vessels and electronic warfare technologies. Until now, the government had only limited tenders for submarines to German defence companies. The expanded strategy is partly designed to make the local defence sector more competitive. The draft stipulates that, if German defence contractors fail to meet the requirements of the German armed forces, tenders will be opened to rivals from the European Union. ""We want to sustain and support the development of core defence capabilities that are of strategic relevance in German as well as in the EU,"" said Economy Minister Peter Altmaier. On Tuesday, lawmakers from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling conservatives backed a proposal to restrict foreign vendors of 5G mobile network technology, sources said, to address the concerns of critics who see the market leader, China's Huawei, as a threat to national security. Under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, Germany plans to reach a defence spending allocation agreed by the NATO military alliance belatedly in 2031, missing a 2024 target. NATO leaders agreed in 2014, after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, to spend the equivalent of 2% of their economic output on defence by 2024. Only seven NATO countries currently meet or exceed that target - the United States, Britain, Greece, Poland and the three Baltic states - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. The German army is set to issue a tender for two tank ships, which under the new rules would be built by German shipyards.

"By Mari Saito and Alun John HONG KONG, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Hong Kong anti-government activists gathered outside a detention centre on Friday, demanding the release of arrested activists and denouncing a police crackdown on a fund-raising platform supporting protesters in need. Congregating outside a detention centre in the western Kowloon district of Lai Chi Kok, the crowds held up signs with the words ""In Solidarity We Stand"", waved flags and demanded the release of all protesters. ""I feel quite sad for the young people, they are fighting for liberty...for us all,"" said Ben, a 68-year-old retiree. After a relative lull in sometimes violent protests that have gripped the former British colony over the past six months, some protesters were alarmed by police moves to freeze HK$70 million ($9 million) in bank deposits held by fund-raiser Spark Alliance. The protesters are angry at perceived Chinese meddling in the city's freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies the charge. Spark Alliance was launched in 2016 to support protesters on a number of fronts including legal fees. Police said they arrested three men and one woman for suspected ""money laundering"", according to a statement. Spark Alliance on its Facebook page said it ""condemned such smear tactics"" by the police. Pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo, who was also at the protest, said the police case was tenuous at best, and she questioned why the fund had run for several years without incident. ""It's too convenient for the authorities to call it money laundering,"" she said. Global banking group HSBC  on Friday strongly denied any link between the police clampdown on Spark Alliance and the earlier closure of an HSBC bank account tied to the group. A small group of protesters had earlier called for a boycott of the bank at its headquarters in the heart of Hong Kong's financial district. ""Our decision (to close the account) is completely unrelated to the Hong Kong police's arrest of the four individuals on 19 December 2019,"" HSBC said in a statement. ""We closed the account in November 2019 following direct instruction from the customer."" Hong Kong has been convulsed by anti-government, pro-democracy protests in the city's worst political crisis in decades. They have also posed a grave populist challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping who just completed an official visit to the neighbouring gambling hub of Macau, which celebrated the 20th anniversary of its handover from Portuguese to Chinese rule. Amid a rising tide of anti-China sentiment, as public anger flares towards China's perceived squeeze on the city's freedoms, some mainland Chinese banks and businesses have been vandalised.

"(Updates with closing U.S. prices) By Julie Ingwersen CHICAGO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures hit their highest in nearly a week on Tuesday as declining U.S. wheat condition ratings and worries about Southern Hemisphere crop prospects fueled a round of short-covering, analysts said. Corn firmed on signs of improving export prospects and soybean futures closed modestly higher. Chicago Board of Trade December wheat settled up 4-3/4 cents at $5.12 per bushel. CBOT December corn ended up 2-1/4 cents at $3.70 a bushel and January soybeans finished up 1-1/4 cents at $9.11-1/2 a bushel. Wheat posted the biggest advance after the U.S. Department of Agriculture late Monday rated 52% of the U.S. winter wheat crop as good to excellent, down from 54% the previous week. Analysts on average had expected a decline of only one percentage point. ""The U.S. weather (and) the decline in ratings are helping the market out,"" said Terry Reilly, senior analyst with Futures International in Chicago. Traders continue to monitor crops in Australia and Argentina, where dry weather has curbed yield prospects, Reilly noted. And commodity funds hold a net short position in CBOT wheat, leaving the market prone to short-covering rallies. Corn futures bounced back after a two-session decline, finding support from a slow U.S. harvest pace as well as questions about plantings in Argentina, where a new president will be inaugurated next month. Peronist Alberto Fernandez beat Argentina's business-friendly incumbent leader Mauricio Macri in an October election. The Peronist party has traditionally supported more government intervention in the economy, including higher export taxes. ""There is serious reconsideration of the size of the Argentine (corn) crop. The second-crop plantings might fall, if it's true that these rumors of tax changes will impact corn the most,"" Reilly said. Signs of improving corn export demand lent support. The USDA on Tuesday said private exporters sold 191,000 tonnes of U.S. corn to unknown destinations, following sales of an additional 132,000 tonnes a day earlier. South Korean buyers booked about 125,000 tonnes of corn in the last day, European traders said, although some was thought to be sourced from Ukraine. ""Brazil is thought to be running out of corn for export, and Argentine corn commitments are running pretty high. So there is some general feeling that some of the business is going to shift to the United States, finally,"" Reilly said. The USDA on Monday said the U.S. corn harvest was 76% complete, below analysts' forecasts of 77% and well below the five-year average of 92%. The USDA also said the U.S. soybean harvest was 91% finished, matching an average of trade expectations but below the five-year average of 95%.

"By Nelson Bocanegra BOGOTA, April 15 (Reuters) - LATAM Airlines Group SA , Latin America's largest carrier, will need regional government support as it undertakes a coronavirus recovery process which could last up to two years, a company executive said on Wednesday. LATAM has grounded the vast majority of its flights and has halved the salaries of its more than 40,000 employees amid widespread quarantines in the region. It operates in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru and until the spread of coronavirus ran about 1,300 flights per day. The airline has enough cash to operate for three to four months, said Santiago Alvarez, LATAM's president for Colombia, in a phone interview. The company, based in Santiago, Chile, has also deferred dividend payments and is requesting payment extensions from suppliers. It has suspended all short- and medium-term investment projects except its digital efforts, Alvarez said. ""In general the company is making efforts to preserve cash as much as it can, but the levels will only last for a short period,"" he said. ""We think with our internal measures we are talking about having cash for around three to four months."" The airline will require government loans to boost liquidity, Alvarez said, with large enough principals and favorable repayment conditions to weather the crisis. ""If we have anything clear it is that we will not be able to come out of this situation individually,"" he added. The aid will be needed well beyond the normalization of operations after coronavirus is controlled, Alvarez said. ""According to analysts and our own calculations we are seeing a recovery period of between 18 and 24 months,"" Alvarez said. ""It will be a period when we will be burning through cash because we will be running flights with low prices and below-average passenger numbers."" Alvarez declined to comment on the possibility of a bankruptcy but said the recovery process would be ""long and painful."" ""That's why we're looking for financial help, because we know we can't do it alone,"" he said. In March the International Air Transport Association asked Latin American governments to eliminate fuel taxes to help airlines as passenger numbers and incomes plummet.

"    By Anita Komuves and Jason Hovet     BUDAPEST/PRAGUE, April 15 (Reuters) - Central European stock markets fell on Wednesday as optimism in global markets was dampened by a further drop in oil prices and corporate earnings reports that showed the extent of economic damage inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic.     The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday predicted that the global economy will shrink by 3% in 2020 - the steepest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.     Bucharest's stock index led the region's losses, shedding more than 2.7% while Warsaw's blue-chip index slipped by 1.5%.      Prague's market was down 2.2%, though shares of Czech state-controlled utility CEZ jumped about 3% after management proposed a dividend of 34 crowns per share, up 42% from the previous payout.     Equities in Budapest were down 2.5%, with oil company MOL plunging more than 6% in morning trade as oil prices continued to drop despite internationally agreed cuts to oil output.     Currencies in the region were stable, with the Czech crown and Hungarian forint both holding on to gains from the previous session.      The forint was at 351.350 against the euro after touching a record low near 370 two weeks ago.     The currency stabilised after the central bank raised its collateralised loan rates last Tuesday and announced a bond-buying programme and massive lending for companies to help them negotiate the coronavirus crisis.      The NPH can also raise the 0.9% rate on its new one-week deposit tool if market conditions justify such a move, the bank's deputy governor said last week.     ""On the economic and political side, Hungary is facing headwinds that should limit the appreciation of the HUF going forward,"" Raiffeisien bank said in a note.     The Czech crown eased by 0.3% and traded at 26.940 against the euro after hitting a four-week high in the previous session.      The currency has been boosted by central banker comments indicating that the bank would be in no rush to use wider asset-purchase powers from new legislation once parliament approves the bill.         The Czech Finance Ministry will hold another regular bond auction on Wednesday as it ramps up borrowing, with the state planning a fivefold increase in the budget deficit to a record 200 billion crowns  ($8.15 billion).      Market participants say a question remains over whether that deficit target will hold, which could result in a slowing of bond issues.     ""Should the final deficit be around this figure, the large supply of debt might soon dry up as the MoF would have already financed some 76% of its needs in that case,"" Komercni Banka trader Dalimil Vyskovsky said.     Central bank policymakers in the region also indicated that further rate cuts are possible to help shore up their economies.     Czech central bank board member Vojtech Benda said in an interview with newspaper E15 on Wednesday that interest rates could go lower.         The Polish central bank could cut rates further, but the scope for lowering them is limited, PAP news agency quoted rate-setter Jerzy Zyzynski as saying on Wednesday.

"(Adds quote by former U.S. official) By Lesley Wroughton WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday named senior policy adviser Brian Hook as Washington's special representative for Iran. The move came as the Trump administration prepared to increase economic pressure on Iran by restoring sanctions to force Tehran to end its nuclear weapons program and support for militant groups in the Middle East. Hook will lead a newly established Iran Action Group to coordinate the State Department's pressure campaign on Iran, Pompeo told a news conference. The announcement was not a surprise. Hook, who has pushed for tough action against Iran, has been leading the department's talks with allies in Europe and Asia to persuade them to support U.S. sanctions and cut off Iran's oil supplies as of November. ""The Iran Action Group will be responsible for directing, reviewing and coordinating all aspects of the State Department's Iran-related activity, and will report directly to me,"" Pompeo said. ""We are committed to a whole-of-government effort to change the Iranian regime’s behavior, and the Iran Action Group will ensure that the Department of State remains closely synchronized with our interagency partners,"" he added. President Donald Trump announced in May the United States was withdrawing from an Iran nuclear deal sealed in 2015 between Tehran and six world powers. The United States has said it would only end the sanctions if Iran allowed the negotiation of a tougher deal. Hook, who was a close adviser to former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, worked with U.S. national security advisor John Bolton on Iran sanctions while Bolton was the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Republican President George W. Bush. Hook also served as an assistant secretary of state during Bush's administration and was an adviser to the Republican presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty. Trump has said he would be willing to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, although Tehran said the way back to talks was for the United States to return to the nuclear deal. Asked whether he supported such a meeting and whether his brief would be to set up those talks, Hook said if Iran showed that it was willing to change its behavior, then Trump ""was prepared to engage in dialogue in order to find solutions."" Washington aims to force Tehran to end its nuclear program and its support of militant groups in the Middle East, where Iran is involved in proxy wars from Yemen to Syria. Iran and other signatories, including Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, have been working to find a way to salvage the nuclear agreement, even as the United States has started reimposing some sanctions on Iran. Dennis Ross, a former U.S. official in Democratic and Republican administrations, said Hook's new post might be a bureaucratic maneuver to try to inject more clarity into Washington's policy toward Tehran. ""It creates an address within the administration for ... making the approach a more coherent one, with someone being given broader responsibility across departments to try to shape the policy,"" said Ross, now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank. ""At least that would be theory."" ""The real question is ... is the policy going to continue to be just, basically, strong tough rhetoric and sanctions ... or is it going to be something more"" to curtail what Washington sees as Iran's destabilizing actions in Syria, Yemen and Iraq?"" he added.

"By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - One in seven people with type 2 diabetes may be needlessly testing their blood sugar at home several times a day, a U.S. study suggests. People with type 2 diabetes don't need to test their blood at home if they have well controlled symptoms and don't take medications that can cause dangerously low blood sugar, doctors say. For these patients, studies have not found that home blood sugar monitoring makes any difference in blood sugar levels. But still, many of them are pricking their fingers unnecessarily. For the current study, researchers examined data on more than 370,000 people with type 2 diabetes. Overall, almost 88,000, or about 23%, had at least three insurance claims for test strips used to check blood sugar at home. More than half of the people testing their blood sugar at home didn't need to do this, accounting for 14% of the total study population, researchers reported December 10 online in JAMA Internal Medicine. ""Many type 2 diabetes patients not using insulin or other medications at risk of rapid changes in blood sugar levels are testing far more often then they need to be,"" said lead study author Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. ""This needless behavior causes unnecessary pokes, worry, and costs,"" Platt said by email. ""More is not always better when it comes to medical care."" Among people in the study who appeared to be needlessly testing blood sugar at home, about 33,000 individuals were taking medications that aren't known to cause hypoglycemia and another 19,000 were not taking any diabetes medicines at all. Half of the patients doing unnecessary blood sugar tests at home did these tests at least twice a day, and half of them had testing supply costs of at least $325 a year, the study found.

"(Updates share price) By Noor Zainab Hussain and Stephen Nellis Oct 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's Azure cloud services grew more slowly in its first quarter even as profit and revenue beat estimates, the company said on Wednesday, a sign that competition is picking up in its fastest-growing business. Revenue from Azure increased 59% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, but came in well below last year's 76% growth. Since Chief Executive Satya Nadella took over in 2014, Microsoft has been diversifying from its Windows operating system software, and has focused on its cloud services, in which customers move their computing work to data centers managed by Microsoft. Strength in that business powered Microsoft's market value past $1 trillion for the first time in April. However, the business faces intense competition from Amazon.com Inc's AWS and Alphabet Inc's Google. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said Microsoft's results ""were strong across the board with nearly all key metrics beating consensus."" But Azure was the key metric that missed slightly, said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company. ""Azure came in at 59% (revenue growth) and consensus was at 60%,"" he said. ""Other than that, it was a good quarter, but if you want to throw rocks at it, that is how you would do it."" Worldwide spending on cloud infrastructure services grew nearly 38% year-on-year in the calendar second quarter to $26.3 billion, according to data from research firm Canalys. Amazon Web Services still dominates the market with a 31.5% share, followed by Microsoft with 18.1%. Microsoft shares, up 34% for the year, were 0.25% lower at $136.90 in after-market trading. The technology company's personal computing division accounted for the largest share of its revenue, rising 4% to $11.13 billion. The unit includes Windows software, Xbox gaming consoles, online search advertising and Surface personal computers. Windows results were boosted by 19% revenue growth for business computers, which was offset by a 7% decline for consumer PCs. Mike Spencer, head of investor relations for Microsoft, said Google Chromebooks continued eat into Windows revenue for entry-level laptops. Net income rose 21% to $10.68 billion, or $1.38 per share, while total revenue rose 14% to $33.06 billion. (https://bit.ly/2W9G9Bc) Analysts had expected a profit of $1.25 per share on revenue of $32.23 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

"(Adds coordinating efforts to counter Nord Stream 2 and other energy projects, paragraph 12) By Jeff Mason WASHINGTON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States is considering a request from Poland for a permanent U.S. military presence in the fellow NATO country, acknowledging that he shares Poland's concerns about possible Russian aggression. Polish President Andrzej Duda asked Trump for a permanent U.S. base during a White House meeting, offering to name it ""Fort Trump,"" and explaining it would be a bulwark against what he considers a threat from Russia. Trump said he agreed with Duda that Moscow had ""acted aggressively"" in the region and said the request for a base was under consideration. He said he appreciated Duda's offer to put more than $2 billion into the project. ""We're looking at it very seriously, I know Poland likes the idea very much, and it's something that we are considering, yes,"" Trump told reporters. Moscow expressed concern in May over reports about Poland's request, saying NATO’s expansion towards Russia’s borders undermined stability in Europe. Poland joined NATO in 1999 along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, and since then other former communist states, including Baltic republics bordering Russia, have joined despite Moscow’s strong opposition. Poland has repeatedly requested a permanent U.S. military presence on its soil. The United States currently rotates troops through Poland temporarily but permanently stationing forces there would be expensive because of costs that can include housing for families, schools and hospitals. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the U.S. military was studying options with Poland but cautioned that no decisions had been made. ""It’s not just about a base. It’s about training ranges, it’s about maintenance facilities at the base, all these kinds of things. There’s a host of details we’ve got to study alongside the Poles,” Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon. Trump and Duda also expressed shared concerns about Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline which they said could make Europe overly reliant on Moscow for energy and expose it to the risks of what Duda called ""political blackmail"" with shipments. But Trump said the United States was not looking to sanction companies that participated in the project with Russia. ""We just think it's very unfortunate for the people of Germany that Germany is paying billions and billions of dollars a year for their energy to Russia,"" he said. In a joint statement released later on Tuesday, after the press conference, Trump and Duda said they will continue coordinating efforts ""to counter energy projects that threaten our mutual security, such as Nord Stream 2."" Trump also said the United States was considering a visa waiver program for Poland.

"Sept 23 (Reuters) - Britain's Whitbread Plc said on Monday it bought three independent hotels in Germany for an undisclosed sum, as the company expands in Europe as part of its focus on the hotel business following the sale of its Costa Coffee chain. The sale of the coffee chain to Coca-Cola Co has left the Premier Inn owner more exposed to increased competition from budget hotel groups and Airbnb when subdued economic activity and political turmoil have forced Britons to rein in spending. Whitbread has looked to counter the weakness in its home market by expanding abroad. The three hotels, located in Nuremburg, Munich and Stuttgart, together comprise 482 rooms, the company, which already runs three hotels in Germany under the Premier Inn brand, said on Monday. They will remain under the current ""Acomhotel"" brand until refurbishment work is completed and then relaunched as Premier Inn hotels, which is expected to be in early 2020. A further 40 hotels are now in the pipeline across 16 key cities in Germany, Whitbread said.

"(Repeats Feb. 18 story with no changes) MILAN, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Italy has started discussions withthe European Union over the renewal of a state guarantee schemedesigned to help banks shed bad loans, a government source saidon Monday. The source said while talks to renew the scheme, set toexpire on March 6, were under way, nothing was imminent.""There's a series of options on the table,"" the source said. Rising risk premiums on Italian assets have made the ""GACS""scheme more costly, but renewal remains important for thecountry's banks which still hold 100 billion euros ($113billion) in bad debts, a legacy of the financial crisis of2007-2009 which had a major negative impact on Italy's economy. Asked on the sidelines of an event in Milan whether GACSwould be renewed, cabinet undersecretary Giancarlo Giorgettitold reporters: ""I think so, what else can we do?"". The scheme was introduced in 2016 to help banks sell badloans at a higher price. Lenders were initially slow to embrace the measure, whichallows them to buy a guarantee from the state to wrap the leastrisky tranche in a sale of bad loans repackaged as securities,but it has since proved a success. Italian banks completed 13 GACS-backed deals in 2018,shedding a nominal 44.3 billion euros in bad debt, or 42 percentof total sales, according to bad loan data group Credit Village. The government said in September it would start talks withEuropean competition authorities to gain approval for a newscheme, possibly widening its scope to include so-called""unlikely-to-pay"" (UTP) loans which are not yet in default. Several sources, however, have told Reuters a widening ofthe measure to UTP loans is proving too complicated to bepursued.

"By Gary McWilliams and Henning Gloystein HOUSTON/SINGAPORE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - In the middle of a Sino-U.S. trade war, the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas company is turning toward Beijing for business at a time when most of Corporate America is looking elsewhere to avoid the threat of tariffs. Exxon Mobil Corp is placing big bets on China's soaring liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, coupling multi-billion dollar production projects around the world with its first mainland storage and distribution outlet. Its gas strategy is moving on two tracks: expanding output of the super-cooled gas in places such as Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, and creating demand for those supplies in China by opening Exxon's first import and storage hub, according to an Exxon manager and people briefed on the company's plans. That combination ""will guarantee us a steady outlet for lots of our LNG for decades,"" said the Exxon manager who was not authorized to discuss the project and spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the company's top policy goals this year, the manager said, is building its Chinese client roster. ""China's natural gas demand is rising really fast, with imports soaring well over 10 percent annually at the moment because of the government gasification program and due to fast rising industrial demand, including in petrochemicals,"" the Exxon manager said. For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2CwGQgT An Exxon spokesperson declined to provide an executive to discuss the company's LNG investments in China. Years in the making, the strategy delivers an added benefit: helping Exxon sidestep a global trade war. Exxon's massive LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique will not incur the 10 percent tariff China put on U.S. gas as part of the trade war between the Trump administration and Beijing. Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG tanker brokers Poten & Partners, which tracks LNG sales, said the deal provides ""a sign that China is willing to let foreign interests invest in things that in the past were seen as strategic."" Exxon is among the top ranked U.S. companies that are pushing ahead in China despite the trade dispute, but it is not alone. U.S. and European car makers are opening or expanding China plants to avoid hefty tariffs and transport costs. Tesla Inc this month acquired a Shanghai site for a car and battery-manufacturing complex. Exxon's Asian and African LNG will offer a cost advantage over U.S. rivals' exports that face tariffs and greater transport, while China's support for the project offers a rebuttal to Trump administration complaints about the country's closed markets. The decision to expand its LNG production and open an import terminal in the world's fastest growing LNG market is a step by Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods to pull the company out of an earnings rut that has left its shares flat over the past seven years. TRADE WAR RISKS Woods appeared holding discussions with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on state-run media last month days after disclosing local approvals for the LNG terminal and a massive chemical project in Guangdong province. Since becoming CEO last year, Woods has pushed Exxon to take greater risks, including in energy trading operations. His timing with LNG is key. Next year, China will become the world's largest importer of natural gas, and its LNG imports are forecast to rise 70 percent by 2020, from 38.1 million tonnes last year, estimates Beijing consultancy SIA Energy. Exxon has not publicly named its partner in the import terminal. State-run power company Guangdong Yuedian Group said on its website it will join the project. BP Plc is the only other foreign oil major with a stake in a Chinese LNG terminal. Yuedian did not respond to a request for comment. The multi-billion dollar bets still faces risks from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute. China has vowed to respond to any new tariffs by the Trump administration, which recently accused China of meddling in November elections and trying to recruit Americans to spy for it. But it remains unclear what that response will be and if it puts agreements like Exxon's in China in jeopardy. In addition to the LNG terminal, Exxon received approval for its first wholly-owned chemical plant in China, becoming one of two foreign firms including Germany's BASF to gain approval to operate such plants without a local sponsor. The terminal and chemicals plants combined will cost about $9 billion to build, consultancy IHS Markit estimates. For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2wDdglt CALL FOR NEW PROJECTS China in 2017 embarked on a huge program to shift millions of households and factories from coal to natural gas for power and heating, a move to clear the smoggy skies over its cities. That surge has injected new life into an LNG industry that suffered from plunging prices between 2014 and 2017, which forced energy companies to put off liquefaction projects. But with prices for LNG rising this year, major producers have boosted investment. In addition to Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell PLC this month gave the go-ahead to a $31 billion LNG Canada project that will export fuel primarily to China. ""Major Independent Oil Companies such as Exxon aim for large-scale tier one positions, and in the LNG game that is Qatar, East Africa, and possibly some North American and Papua New Guinea projects,"" said Saul Kavonic, oil and gas researcher for Credit Suisse in Sydney, Australia. Exxon and other LNG producers also are adapting to changing buyer behavior. In the past, LNG was dominated by long-term supply contracts - especially with Japanese and South Korean buyers - that could span several decades and in which buyer and seller agree to a fixed monthly volume at a set price formula, usually priced off crude oil. That is changing, in part because China's importers either demand more contract flexibility or simply buy LNG at short-notice in the spot market whenever they need it. The shift away from such rigid price-supply deals is forcing producers to trade new LNG supplies and give import terminals a larger role in encouraging spot purchases. ""LNG players are increasingly adopting an LNG portfolio model whereby supply projects are not directly linked to end customers, with over 50 percent of contracts now coming from portfolio suppliers rather than specific projects,"" said Credit Suisse's Kavonic.

The wheat is being bought at $267.30 a tonne, which includescost, insurance and freight, and other port-related expenses. Russian state firm Prodintorg will supply the wheat, withthe first batch of around 52,000 tonnes arriving in the firstweek of August, one of the officials said. The import price is slightly lower than the lowest offer of$267.98 a tonne that the state grains buyer received in its lasttender to buy 50,000 tonnes of wheat. Bangladesh imported 200,000 tonnes of wheat from Russia inan inter-state deal in 2017 after Dhaka rejected three cargoesof Russian wheat totalling 150,000 tonnes over quality concerns. The country has turned to the Black Sea region for wheat inrecent months because supply from India has dwindled as Indiangrain is needed to meet its growing domestic demand. The state grains buyer imported 550,000 tonnes of wheat inthe year to June, officials said. Apart from government purchases, private traders importabout 5.5 million tonnes of wheat annually to meet growingdemand, while the country's output has stagnated at about 1million tonnes.

"March 2 (Reuters) - The organizers of the Grammy Awards said on Monday they fired the chief executive they had placed on administrative leave in January. Recording Academy Chief Executive and President Deborah Dugan was placed on leave just five months after taking the helm as the organization's first female president and pledging to bring more diversity to the body, whose members vote on the highest prizes in the music industry. The board cited an unspecified allegation of misconduct against Dugan by a female member of the Recording Academy, as well as ""consistent management deficiencies and failures."" “After weighing all of the evidence from two independent investigations, the Board of Trustees of the Recording Academy voted to terminate Ms. Dugan from her role as President/CEO,"" interim CEO Harvey Mason Jr said in a statement. ""We will initiate a search for a new leader who will leverage the Academy’s diverse membership and rich history and help us transform it to better serve our members today and into the future,"" he added. Dugan's lawyers said in a statement on Monday that the decision showed the Recording Academy ""will stop at nothing to protect and maintain a culture of misogyny, discrimination, sexual harassment, corruption and conflicts of interest."" The dispute erupted days before the Grammy Awards ceremony on Jan. 28, although the ceremony was not affected. Dugan later filed a counter complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging gender discrimination, unlawful retaliation and unequal pay. She also described what she called a ""boys' club mentality"" at the Recording Academy, and claimed that conflicts of interest among members unfairly affect Grammy nominations. The Recording Academy denied that the Grammy nominations process was rigged. Dugan took over from Neil Portnow, who in 2018 had provoked outrage by telling reporters that female artists and producers needed to ""step up"" if they wanted recognition in the music industry. The Recording Academy in December said it would double the number of female voters by 2025 by adding 2,500 more women. Teen newcomer Billie Eilish was the biggest winner at this year's Grammy Awards, winning five trophies, including album and song of the year and best new artist.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong/Shanghai-August 22: Chinese state-owned enterprises(SOE) will continue to be the key participants of debt-for-equity swapprogrammes, while privately-owned entities' (POE) participation will berelatively limited due to Chinese banks' low risk appetite for these companies,Fitch Ratings says. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) aims to reduce POEs'credit risks and rejuvenate the private sector by encouraging more POEs topursue market-oriented debt-for-equity swaps with financial institutions,according to the commission's working guidelines for corporates to reduceleverage released 29 July 2019. China will allow more social capital includinginsurance companies to participate in these swap programmes, set up platformsfor asset restructurings, and will encourage commercial banks to participatethrough granting additional cuts in their reserve-requirement ratios. However, Fitch believes commercial banks, the key participants of theprogrammes, have little incentive to become equity investors in POEs due to thehigher risks of equities and their greater risk weights relative to loans.Recently reported accounting frauds and corporate governance scandals at a fewPOEs may further deter banks from pursuing debt-for-equity deals with POEs. Forexample, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (A/Stable) agreed to aswap involving Kangmei Industry Investment Holdings, the parent of KangmeiPharmaceutical Co., in October 2018. However, Kangmei Pharmaceuticalsubsequently filed a statement in April 2019 regarding an overstatement of itscash holdings by CNY29.9 billion as of end-2017, which fuelled investor concernsover the potential for accounting fraud or other irregular practices. This suggests banks will continue to favour SOEs in debt-for-equity swapprogrammes, and will be highly selective in picking candidates among POEs, suchas only those with stronger business profiles that may be facing a temporaryliquidity shortage. Only 24 out of the 367 debt-for-equity deals implementedinvolved investments in POEs as of April 2019. The majority of the companies inwhich debt was swapped for equity had domestic ratings of 'AA+' and above. Thedomestic market generally considers companies with 'AA+' and above domesticratings to have below-average credit risk on a relative basis, although theircreditworthiness could be perceived differently by international investors.China's five-biggest state commercial banks have collectively carried out 254transactions as of April 2019, contributing around 70% of the total.

"(Adds Aramco comment, background) By Rania El Gamal DUBAI, April 1 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's crude supply rose on Wednesday to a record of more than 12 million barrels per day, two industry sources said, despite a plunge in demand triggered by the coronavirus outbreak and U.S. pressure on the kingdom to stop flooding the market. A producer pact to rein in oil production expired on Tuesday, removing restrictions on output by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as Russia and other producing nations. Saudi Arabia had said that its oil exports would be about 10 million bpd, but it gave no indication of how much crude would go into storage. One of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Aramco has increased its production to its maximum capacity of 12 million bpd. Supply to the market, both domestically and for export, may differ from production depending on the volumes taken out of storage. Saudi Arabia has hundreds of millions of barrels of crude in storage inside the kingdom and abroad. The national oil company Saudi Aramco declined to comment. Riyadh's plan to boost its production and supply to the market defies increasing pressure from Washington to end a battle with Russia for market share. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would join Saudi Arabia and Russia, if need be, for talks about the fall in oil prices, which at current levels will squeeze out higher cost production, particularly U.S. shale output, which had surged in recent years. U.S. lawmakers have taken a tough approach - raising the prospect of legislative action if Riyadh does not reduce oil output voluntarily. Crude oil benchmarks ended a volatile first quarter with their biggest losses in history. On Wednesday, oil slid towards $25 a barrel, after touching its lowest level in 18 years. On Tuesday, a Saudi oil industry source told Reuters Aramco has asked energy service companies to support its plans to lift oil production to its maximum capacity of 12 million bpd from April 1 ""for the foreseeable future"". The state oil giant has also told the service companies to ""avail the required resources, including workforce and equipment"" to help it raise its capacity to 13 million bpd, the source said. But Saudi oil officials have yet to explain how Saudi Arabia can raise shipments so much when sweeping retractions on movement to contain the coronavirus are destroying demand and surging freight rates are a further deterrent for potential buyers. Saudi Arabia has struggled to find customers for its extra oil, industry sources said, undermining the kingdom's efforts to capture market share.

"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * LME Aluminium Price and Stocks: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Qo8TnZ By Andy Home LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - China's aluminium smelters lifted production by 2.4% over the first two months of this year. The increase was testament to producers' ability to keep operating over the worst of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the country's aluminium processing sector, which transforms raw metal into semi-manufactured products (""semis"") and which is only now limping back to normality. The disconnect is becoming evident in surging stocks held in Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) warehouses. With end-use demand collapsed in key sectors such as automotive, the dissonance with rising smelter production becomes ever more striking. Where China is today, the rest of the world will be tomorrow as the virus spreads. The global aluminium industry has a terrible record of responding to demand shocks. It is still living with some of the inventory accumulated in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis a decade ago. Will this time be any different? The early-year figures from China don't offer much cause for optimism. CHINA SUPPLY BULGE ShFE stocks have mushroomed from 185,127 tonnes at the end of December to 519,542 tonnes. That may be just the tip of the iceberg with more metal trapped at smelters by logistical bottle-necks. A plea by China's National Nonferrous Metals Industry Association for the government to step in and buy up unsold inventory in the guise of ""strategic"" stockpiling is a sure sign of sector stress. So too is an eight-month suspension of ShFE fees for delivering metal to exchange warehouses, a step intended to ""ease the financial pressure on market participants,"" according to the exchange. Total reported aluminium ingot inventory in China grew by 17% from 1.24 million tonnes on Feb. 21 to 1.45 million tonnes on March 6, according to Doug Hilderhoff, principal analyst for North American aluminium at research house CRU. (""Market View"", Aluminum Association, March 6, 2020) ""Stocks are expected to further increase throughout March but may peak in April when aluminium semis plants have fully restarted and have worked off inventory at the plants,"" Hilderhoff said. That, however, may amount to no more than pushing the supply bulge down the value chain if end-use demand in China hasn't recovered by then. China has historically exported domestic market surplus in the form of semi-manufactured products, which unlike primary metal aren't subject to an export tax. Exports of semis slid by 1.5% last year and slumped by 23% in January and February as China's stringent quarantine measures compounded normal seasonal new year slowdown. However, this might be the calm before the export storm if China's growing surplus overwhelms end-use demand before Beijing can engineer a manufacturing stimulus. WESTERN CONTAGION It's noticeable that the Shanghai aluminium price has fallen by 12% since the start of January, while that in London is down by ""only"" 6% at a current $1,652 per tonne. The Chinese market is pricing in its current domestic supply surge. The non-Chinese market isn't there yet. But it may not have long to wait as the economic chill of mass quarantines spreads around the rest of the world. The canary in the coal mine for aluminium producers is the rapid collapse of automotive production, a core end-use sector and one with complex, international supply chains. Carmakers including Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot and Volkswagen cut production at European plants on Monday in the face of quarantine measures and imploding demand for new cars. The last even remotely comparable shock was that of 2008-2009, when the automotive sector was a key transmitter of credit crisis to manufacturing crunch. Western aluminium producers cut production by too little too late to prevent a surge in unsold metal stocks. The simultaneous collapse in credit markets saw that metal flood into London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses. Registered LME aluminium stocks rose from 1.17 million tonnes in August 2008 to 4.61 million in August 2009. The legacy has been long-lasting, not just in terms of the aluminium price but also in terms of the LME's warehouse function, which has been distorted by the weight of all that metal ever since. UNDER PRESSURE It's true that the aluminium smelting process doesn't make it easy to switch off a plant. It takes time and can cost a lot of money, particularly if long-term power deals have to be renegotiated. However, Western producers should heed the warning of the last crisis. If run-rates aren't curtailed voluntarily, the price will end up forcing involuntary closures. The prolonged period of low pricing over the first part of the last decade left a long trail of smelter casualties, many of them permanent. This particular demand crisis couldn't have happened at a worse time for global producers. Last year was a particularly weak one for global aluminium demand, which is estimated by Russian producer Rusal to have eked out minimal growth of just 0.1%. The price was already under pressure and producers were struggling even before the coronavirus. Alcoa announced in October last year a review of 1.5 million tonnes of smelting capacity. Magnitude 7 Metals, which brought the bankrupt New Madrid smelter in Missouri back into operation in 2018, is ""in prayer mode"", according to chief executive Charles Reali. The remaining seven operating U.S. smelters are high on the potential hit list if the international price starts following the Shanghai price lower. That poses an interesting question of a U.S. Administration that has sought to preserve its domestic smelters by import tariffs. One possibility, discussed by Citi analysts in a recent note, is for a hike in the tariff from 10% to 25%, matching that already levied on steel imports. (""US Midwest aluminium premium risks heavily skewed to the upside,"" March 11, 2020) That would mechanically feed through to an 80% increase in Midwest U.S. aluminum premiums to around 25 cents/lb, Citi argues. Even such a regional divergence, however, could only provide partial protection against a downturn in the global price from what are already margin-compression levels for producers. The only way to avoid the mistakes of crisis past is coordinated global production cuts. Don't hold your breath.

Stocks initially showed little reaction to the Fed's policy statement but steadily lost ground on the heels of a news conference by chairman Jerome Powell. The Fed held rates steady as expected while offering no new guidance on its balance sheet, but Powell noted ""uncertainties about the outlook remain"" and noted the coronavirus outbreak in China. Since the Fed's last rate cut in October, its third reduction of 2019, policymakers have agreed to keep their target policy rate in the current range of 1.50% and 1.75%. Apple Inc gained 2.09% after the iPhone maker late on Tuesday reported earnings for the holiday shopping quarter that topped analysts' expectations, even as it braced for more disruptions in virus-hit China. Boeing Co rose 1.72% after the planemaker forecast nearly $19 billion in costs related to the grounding of its 737 MAX jets, smaller than what many analysts had expected, and helping offset the company's report of its first annual loss since 1997. Several companies have warned of disruption to their operations due to the coronavirus outbreak, and a Chinese government economist was quoted as saying the country's economic growth may drop to 5% or even lower. ""I don’t mean to minimize the human impact of the virus but what is more concerning to me is not that the market has not responded to the virus but rather that it was up so strongly in the first 2-1/2 weeks of January after a very, very strong 2019,"" said Ellen Hazen, portfolio manager at F.L.Putnam Investment Management in Wellesley, Massachusetts. ""The market does seem to have gotten ahead of itself."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.6 points, or 0.04%, to 28,734.45, the S&P 500 lost 2.84 points, or 0.09%, to 3,273.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.48 points, or 0.06%, to 9,275.16. As earnings gather pace, analysts expect profit for S&P 500 companies to be flat in the fourth quarter, an improvement over the 0.6% decline estimated at the start of the season, according to Refinitiv data. General Electric jumped 10.32% after the industrial conglomerate set a higher cash target for 2020. Starbucks Corp dropped 2.12% after warning of a financial hit as it closed thousands of restaurants and adjusted operating hours in China. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 46 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 65 new lows.

"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, acolumnist for Reuters.) By Andy Home LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - China imported 128,000 tonnes ofrefined lead last year, bringing the two-year cumulative totalto 206,000 tonnes. The only precedent for this pace of import was 2009, whenChina soaked up 157,000 tonnes of refined lead. It's a problematic comparison though, given lead prices andarbitrage were distorted back then by the global financialcrisis and Beijing's resulting rush to support its ownproducers. The import surge dried up in 2010 and China became a netexporter of refined lead to the rest of the world over the2013-2016 period. The scale of imports since then is a clear sign there is areal physical shortfall in China, normally the sort of narrativeto excite metals bulls. This being lead, however, you'd be hard pushed to discerneven the faintest flicker of bullish enthusiasm in either theShanghai or London futures markets. The London Metal Exchange (LME) lead contract is currentlystable, but as long as China's appetite remains this strong,there could yet be a bull storm brewing. DOUBLE TROUBLE IN CHINA China is both the largest producer and consumer of lead, asis the case with many industrial metals. Lead's dominant usage in automotive batteries leaves itexposed to the downturn in China's automotive sector. Automobilesales dropped another 15.8 percent in January, marking theseventh straight month of decline in the world's largest automarket. However, weak demand is being offset by even weakerproduction, China's internal supply of lead suffering a doubleblow over the last couple of years. Secondary production, using scrap lead as an input, is amajor component of Chinese supply as it is everywhere else. It's a sector that has come in for Beijing's ""structuralreform"" treatment with smaller operators being squeezed out infavour of more modern, larger plants using new technology tocomply with increasingly tough emissions standards. The reform process will provide structure to a previouslyfragmented industry but it comes at the short-term cost ofsupply chain disruption. Primary producers, those turning mined concentrates intorefined lead, have not been spared the rolling environmentalclamp-down taking place across China's industrial landscape. But they have also had to face declining availability ofconcentrates, both domestic and imported. The International Lead and Zinc Group (ILZSG) estimates thatChina's mined lead production fell by 3.4 percent last year, thesecond straight year of contraction. Mine production in the rest of the world grew by only amarginal 0.7 percent and the resulting tightness has taken itstoll on China's concentrates imports. These have fallen for three consecutive years. The bulkweight total was 1.23 million tonnes last year, down by 35percent, or 672,000 tonnes, on 2015. Tightness in the raw materials section of the supply chainhas travelled to the refined metal sector in China, withproduction, primary and secondary combined, falling by 1 percentlast year, according to ILZSG. Visible inventory in China remains low with Shanghai FuturesExchange (ShFE) stocks totalling just 29,355 tonnes at the endof last week. There has been a small rebuild over the last couple ofmonths but it has been insignificant relative to the tonnagebeing imported. BECALMED MARKET Low ShFE stocks may also reflect the current lack of tradinginterest in the Shanghai lead contract. Prices have done no more than shuffle sideways since thesecond quarter of 2018 and open interest touched a three-yearlow in January, from which it has barely recovered. Similarly in London, where LME three-month lead isthe second-weakest performer in the base metals pack so far thisyear, opening up a wide discount of over $600 per tonne tosister metal zinc. Zinc is back on investors' radar thanks to rapidly decliningLME stocks and a realisation that more mine supply does notautomatically mean more refined metal supply if there is asmelter bottle-neck. LME lead stocks, by comparison, have failed to transmit sucha tradeable signal. At a headline level of 76,725 tonnes stocks are historicallylow and are down by 30,650 tonnes on the start of January. However, any clear-cut pattern has been broken by a slightlybewildering sequence of cancellations, reverse cancellations and""arrivals"". LME lead stocks have a history of such ambiguity, much ofwhich is down to the fact that what's left in the LME warehousesystem is increasingly old metal. Mass cancellations have often been followed by mass""arrivals"" because physical buyers have baulked at the technicalspecifications of the metal, leaving the owner little choice butto place it back on LME warrant. Such stocks rotation, driven by warrant sifting, has been adefining feature of the LME lead market for several years butthe resulting ""noise"" doesn't help any coherent marketnarrative. DEFICIT TODAY, SURPLUS TOMORROW? ILZSG estimates the global refined lead market recorded asupply-usage deficit of 98,000 tonnes last year, following a148,000-tonne shortfall in 2017. The cumulative deficit has, on paper, been large enough toabsorb the preceding years of surplus and cause a significantdrawdown in off-market, statistically invisible stocks. In this regard, lead's fundamentals look similar to those ofzinc, not entirely surprising given that most of the world'slead concentrates come as a by-product from zinc mining. As with zinc, the consensus has been that a new wave ofmines will reinvigorate a depleted supply chain and push theglobal market into surplus. The zinc market seems to be currently reassessing thisscenario as new mine supply fails to translate fully intoimproved metal availability. To date there has been no such reassessment of the leadmarket. ILZSG's most recent forecast, in October last year, was fora switch to a 50,000-tonne surplus this year. But in April last year it was projecting a minimal refinedmarket deficit of 17,000 tonnes in 2018. It dramatically revised that forecast in October, factoringin China's increased imports, a key statistical component forcalculating Chinese market balance. On current trends, ILZSG may have to revise this year'sbalance again at its spring meeting. China's lead imports in January were 25,800 tonnes,exceeding the total amount of metal imported between 2011 and2016. If they carry on at this pace, even the somnolent leadmarket might start noticing.

"(Adds charts, no change to text) By Samuel Shen and Noah Sin SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, Feb 27 (Reuters) - A surge in small-cap Chinese stocks, fueled by government stimulus measures to support the virus-hit economy, is triggering fears of a repeat of the boom that preceded the 2015 market crash. China has injected massive funds into the banking system, cut interest rates and encouraged lenders to extend cheap loans to limit the financial fallout from the coronavirus epidemic, which has hit businesses hard, from retailers to manufacturers. Shenzhen's tech-heavy start-up board ChiNext has jumped 13.1% this month through Wednesday, far outpacing the 1.7% gain in China's blue-chip CSI 300 index. A broader index of tech shares including start-ups and more established names such as ZTE has gained 14%. ""This is already a bubble. It's a game of the greater fool,"" said Shen Shikai, an investor who has been managing money pooled from his friends for over a decade. ""The economy has stalled for two months, and companies' first-quarter earnings will be ugly. Why on earth are stocks trading at such a level?"" ChiNext is trading at 59 times last year's earnings, up from roughly 30 a year ago and 47 at end-2019. In New York, the Nasdaq is trading at 26.5 times trailing earnings, according to Refinitiv data. Fan Huang, head of wealth management at Deutsche Bank (China) Ltd, said the central bank's monetary easing was ""directly contributing to investors' speculative activities."" In a Feb. 24 blog post, he urged investors not to forget the lessons of the 2015 market meltdown. That crash wiped more than $5 trillion in capitalisation off the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, with ChiNext losing half its value within months. Li Shoushuang, a capital markets lawyer at Dentons, called on the government to cool the market by introducing capital gains tax on share trading - something Beijing has always avoided. ""China's stock market is not a barometer of economic health. Rather, it's a barometer of liquidity,"" he said. TECH FEVER Some investors, however, believe the rally has solid footing, based in large part on Beijing's drive to make China more technologically self-sufficient as it battles the United States over trade. Others are also pointing to an expected innovation boom in 5G, the fifth-generation wireless technology. ""If you look through the lens of China's great economic transformation over the next 3-10 years, you'll realize we're just at the starting point of a big bull (market),"" said Wen Xunneng, a Shanghai-base hedge fund manager. ""Don't fight the trend."" Adding to the fervour, mutual fund managers have been aggressively pitching tech-focused products. Hwabao WP Fund Management Co's flagship technology ETF has seen its assets under management nearly double this year to over 14 billion yuan ($2 billion). Huang Yue, fund manager at Guotai Fund Management Co, was promoting products via an online roadshow on Tuesday that invest in the semiconductor, telecommunication, and computer industries. ""It's true that valuation of chip stocks is near historic highs. But we also expect to see a big jump in earnings."" FROTH Bubble believers have pointed to particular share jumps as signs that markets have grown too frothy. Shares in Jiangsu Xiuqiang Glasswork Co have tripled this month on speculation that the glass maker will enter into a tie-up with Tesla. The company says it's unaware of any factors that pushed up its stock. Last week, cleaning robot maker Beijing Roborock Technology jumped 85% in its STAR Market debut after an initial price offering (IPO) oversubscribed more than 3,000 times. ""With all the millions and millions of Chinese on lock-down, more people have more time to dabble in the stock markets,"" said Grizelda Lee, head of discretionary portfolio management, Asia, Indosuez Wealth Management, referring to strict public health measures to contain the virus. Daily trading volume in Shenzhen - home to many smaller firms - hit an all-time high on Tuesday, surpassing that of blue-chip and large-cap heavy Shanghai market. Rocky Fan, economist at Sealand Securities, said regulators appeared to be tolerating speculation as a booming market will help already-listed companies raise fresh funds. He cautioned against calling it a bubble, however, saying lower interest rates were also making stocks more attractive. ""You only know it's a bubble after it bursts.""

"KABUL, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Talks between U.S. and Talibanofficials aimed at arranging peace negotiations in Afghanistanwere set for a second day on Tuesday after discussions aroundthe future of foreign forces and a possible six-month ceasefire,Taliban sources said. The three-day meeting in Abu Dhabi is at least the thirdtime that U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has metTaliban representatives as diplomatic efforts to end the 17-yearwar have intensified this year. On Monday, a Taliban delegation met officials from SaudiArabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates ahead of theirmeeting with Khalilzad, who was appointed to overseeWashington's peace effort in September. Taliban officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthe U.S. delegation was pressing for a six-month ceasefire aswell as an agreement to name Taliban representatives to a futurecaretaker government. The officials said the Taliban, fighting to drive foreignforces from Afghanistan and bring in their version of strictIslamic law, were resisting a ceasefire as they felt it woulddamage their cause and help U.S. and Afghan forces. ""If these three countries - Saudi Arabia, UAE and Pakistan -become guarantors and the U.S. appoints the head of a caretakergovernment in Afghanistan that we nominate, then we can thinkabout a ceasefire,"" one senior Taliban official said. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. embassy inKabul. The latest round of diplomacy comes about a year after theUnited States sent thousands of extra troops to Afghanistan andstepped up air strikes to record levels, with the aim of pushingthe Taliban to accept talks. However, despite U.S. insistence that any peace settlementmust be agreed between Afghans, the Taliban have refused to talkdirectly with officials from the Kabul government, which theyconsider an illegitimate, foreign-appointed regime. ""Talks revolved around withdrawal of occupation forces fromAfghanistan, ending the oppression being carried out by theUnited States and her allies and views were exchanged with thesaid countries about peace and reconstruction of Afghanistan,""Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement. An Afghan government team travelled to Abu Dhabi ""to beginproximity dialogue with the Taliban delegation and to preparefor a face-to-face meeting between the two sides"", governmentspokesman Haroon Chakansuri said in a statement. But there was no sign from the Taliban that they were readyto accept talks with the government. On Monday, Mujahiddismissed reports of a meeting as ""propaganda"". The United States says the aim of the talks is to facilitatean Afghan-led process and the inclusion of Saudi Arabia, the UAEand Pakistan in the talks reflects a U.S. desire to bring incountries with an interest in Afghanistan.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10101859 Fitch Ratings-Chicago-November 21: The slowdown in gathering and processing (G&P) volume growth for small to midsized North American Midstream Energy companies could continue in 2020, delaying expected deleveraging, according to Fitch Ratings. However, lower capex and some producer volume growth, completion of contractually supported projects, and asset sales should support stable to improved credit profiles for larger, more diversified companies. US crude oil and natural gas production growth is expected in 2020 but at a slower rate than prior forecasts. The Permian midstream infrastructure build-out should support production growth and higher exports, despite a lower basin rig count. However, pockets of weakness will likely exist for small to midsized G&P issuers with high volumetric and/or high geographic or counterparty concentration given exposure to the slowing volume growth trend. Larger, more diversified and long-haul pipeline issuers should demonstrate more stability. Balance sheet strengthening and pursuing a self-funding operating model will remain central tenets for the sector but an immaterial improvement in median leverage versus 2019 for large investment-grade issuers is projected. Sector capex is expected to trend lower but some large issuers have quick-to-build expansion opportunities that may cause short-term increases in leverage with deleveraging expected quickly thereafter. Median FCF for the sector is expected to trend toward breakeven, due in part to lower growth capex and more realistic growth in distributions. Other events to monitor include legal or regulatory decisions on pipelines; including Mountain Valley, Atlantic Coast, Keystone XL and the TransMountain Expansion, among others. The impact on the oil & gas industry from the implementation of International Maritime Organization (IMO) 2020 on January 1 is uncertain and the US Presidential election could adversely affect the sector if there is a more stringent regulatory regime put in place. Moreover, regulatory initiatives on a state and local level in the US highlight growing public concerns around domestic oil and gas production and consumption could have future regional production and demand implications. Reduced demand due to global economic conditions, exploration and production bankruptcies, and increased use of acreage dedications versus minimum volume commitment contracts for new G&P business could negatively affect cash flow and cash flow visibility. However, sector liquidity and debt market access should be adequate for Midstream issuers. This is in contrast to deep high-yield upstream peers where capital market access remains constrained. Asset sales, project financing and joint ventures are viable funding alternatives to raising debt for Midstream issuers as equity issuance is expected to remain limited. We expect M&A activity to continue in 2020 but large-scale transactions are likely to be limited by balance sheet constraints. High-yield company valuations continue to drive private equity interest in the sector but interest could wane due to pockets of underperformance. LBOs such as the buyout of Buckeye Partners and pending buyout of Tallgrass Energy Partners are generally negative for creditors. Few rating changes are expected for large investment-grade North American Midstream issuers in 2020 but downward pressure on ratings for small to midsized, weakly positioned G&P issuers is possible. The Rating Outlook for 72% of Fitch's rated Midstream universe is Stable but the percentage of issuers with a Negative Rating Outlook or Negative Watch is the highest since 2014 at 22%. Only 6% have a Positive Outlook/Watch. Nearly all issuers with a Negative Outlook/Watch are currently rated 'BBB-' or lower. The potential cross-over issuers include EnLink Midstream, ITT Holdings, Tallgrass Energy, Western Midstream and EQM Midstream. The 'BB' and 'B' rated issuers' rating trajectories will largely be driven by the success or lack of success of 2020 producer drilling programs and commodity prices over the year. <iframe src=""https://e.infogram.com/0cb63b90-688b-4175-889d-9a9f64270f30?src=embed"" title=""NA Midstream Rating Outlooks - CNT CNT"" width=""550"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none;"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""> The full report, <a href=""https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10101859"">Fitch Ratings 2020 Outlook: North America Midstream Energy (Underwhelming Volume Growth Expectations Dim Outlook), is available at www.fitchratings.com.

"(Adds data details, background) By Michael Nienaber BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German annual inflation picked up in October to reach its highest level in more than 6-1/2 years, data showed on Tuesday, supporting European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's case for gradually winding down his unprecedented monetary stimulus. German consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by 2.4 percent year-on-year after an increase of 2.2 percent in the previous month, the Federal Statistics Office said. That was the highest reading since February 2012 and in line with market expectations. The ECB targets inflation of close to but below 2 percent for the single-currency bloc as a whole. On a non-harmonized basis, consumer price inflation even hit a 10-year high at 2.5 percent, the data showed. Price pressures picked up on a broad basis, suggesting that the rise was also driven by core inflation and not only by the more volatile energy and food components. Germany's preliminary inflation data do not include a figure for core inflation. With price pressures building in the euro zone, the ECB last week confirmed its plan to end its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.96 trillion) bond-buying programme at the end of this year and raise interest rates for the first time since 2011 sometime after next summer. The euro zone will publish preliminary inflation data for October on Wednesday, with the headline figure expected to pick up to 2.2 percent after 2.1 percent in September. The inflation figures chimed with data released earlier on Tuesday that showed Germany's jobless total fell in October and employment hit a record high in September, underlining the strength of a labour market that is supporting a consumer-led upswing in Europe's largest economy.

"(Adds Los Angeles taking similar measure) By Leela de Kretser NEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - The mayors of New York City and Los Angeles, the two largest cities in the United States, on Sunday said they were ordering restaurants, theaters, bars and movie houses closed in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Any restaurant, bar or cafe selling food will only be able to do so via delivery or take-out, officials said. ""The virus can spread rapidly through the close interactions New Yorkers have in restaurants, bars and places where we sit close together,"" said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. ""We have to break that cycle."" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Sunday night that he was also ordering gyms closed, too. Both mayors said they were not making their decisions lightly. ""These places are part of the heart and soul of our city. They are part of what it means to be a New Yorker,"" de Blasio said. ""But our city is facing an unprecedented threat, and we must respond with a wartime mentality."" De Blasio said his order would be in effect on Tuesday at 9 a.m. In Los Angeles the restrictions would take effect at midnight on Sunday. There was no word yet on how long the businesses in New York would remain closed - the mayor's office did not immediately respond to requests for detail. Garcetti said Los Angeles businesses affected by his order must stay closed until March 31, adding that he may extend the order. More than 50,000 restaurants in New York were expected to shutter by Tuesday morning. According to the National Restaurant Association, restaurants account for more than $51 billion in annual revenue and have more than 800,000 employees. ""We will come through this, but until we do, we must make whatever sacrifices necessary to help our fellow New Yorkers,"" de Blasio said. Before word of the mayor's order came out, a New York police cruiser was seen in the East Village neighborhood, a pillar of the city's night life scene, telling patrons of bars and restaurants to disperse and go home. Several businesses closed up shop shortly afterward. For restaurant owner Julio Pena, the New York City shutdown looks devastating. Pena, who managed to keep his Il Posto Accanto restaurant open in the aftermath of 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy, doesn't know how he or other businesses will survive. ""Throughout whatever situation we've always opened, not only for staff and to pay the bills, but because the community needs us,"" he said.

"SINGAPORE, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Singaporean telecom operator StarHub Ltd said on Wednesday it would cut about 12 percent of its workforce as part of a strategic revamp that will include focusing and investing in new areas such as cybersecurity. The estimated 300 job cuts will mainly affect non-customer facing functions, the company said, adding that on-going natural attrition and tighter management of contractor roles will result in additional roles being made redundant. The company, which also provides pay TV services, had 2,500 employees as of end-2017. Competition in Singapore's mature telecom sector is heating up, with Australia's TPG Telecom set to become the city state's fourth telecom company. At the same time, streaming applications such as Netflix have been challenging traditional pay TV providers. ""Technological innovation and competition are redefining how we deliver services to our customers and we at StarHub need to transform our operating model, otherwise we will face greater risks in the future,"" StarHub CEO Peter Kaliaropoulos said in a statement. StarHub expects savings of S$210 million ($152.7 million) over a three-year period from 2019 from the revamp, which includes other measures such as reducing leasing costs and sales and distribution expenses. It estimated a one-off restructuring cost of about S$25 million ($18.2 million).

The public facilities revenue bonds are backed by the county's covenant toappropriate in its annual budget sufficient amounts of legally available non advalorem revenues (NAV) to replenish any deficiency in the debt service reservefund (DSRF) for the bonds. The DSRF is funded from cash in an amount equal tomaximum annual debt service (MADS). The bonds are payable in the first instancefrom revenue generated from the operation of a number of county-owned publichealth care facilities operated by the Public Health Trust (PHT), which includesthe proceeds of a voter-approved half-cent sales tax. The professional sports franchise facilities tax (PSFFT) revenue bonds arebacked by a first lien on a 1% PSFFT and a 2% tourist development tax (TDT). ThePSFFT and TDT (the pledged dedicated taxes) each constitute a tax on the rentalof facilities such as hotels, motels and other transient accommodationscountywide (excluding facilities within the municipal limits of the cities ofMiami Beach, Bal Harbour and Surfside). In addition, the county has covenantedto budget and appropriate sufficient NAV revenues to make up any deficiency inPSFFT and TDT revenue to pay debt service. The county can be released from theNAV covenant if the combined PSFFT and TDT equal at least 150% of MADS in eachof the preceding two fiscal periods. IDR ANALYTICAL CONCLUSION The 'AA' IDR reflects the county's very strong capacity to manage cyclicaleconomic and budgetary challenges while maintaining an adequate level offundamental financial flexibility. This is supported by the county's highrevenue raising authority, more moderate capacity to adjust spending from both alegal and practical perspective, and its improved operating stability and fundbalance position. Additionally, long-term liabilities are expected to remainmoderate despite pressures from a significant capital plan. The 'AA-' on thepublic facilities revenue bonds (Jackson Health System) reflects the county'sNAV covenant and is notched off the IDR. DEDICATED TAX ANALYTICAL CONCLUSION The 'A+' rating on the PSFFT revenue bonds also reflects the county's NAVcovenant, which Fitch deems to be of higher credit quality than the dedicatedtax analysis on the PSFFT and TDT revenue stream. The two-notch ratingdistinction from the county IDR reflects the potential release of the NAVcovenant upon satisfaction of certain coverage requirements, which Fitch viewsas an additional risk factor, albeit one with a low likelihood of occurrenceuntil near final maturity of the bonds based on revenue analysis. (SEE BELOW FOR DEDICATED TAX ANALYSIS) Economic Summary Miami-Dade is the seventh largest county in the U.S. by population and theanchor of the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan statisticalarea (MSA), which is one of the U.S.'s largest economic centers. Trade andtransportation is the leading sector by employment reflecting the county'sposition as a gateway for trade with Latin American countries. Miami's tourismand real estate markets are also key drivers of economic activity, butsusceptible to periods of high volatility through economic cycles. A highincidence of poverty is another economic vulnerability. IDR KEY RATING DRIVERS Revenue Framework:  'aa' Fitch considers Miami-Dade's revenue growth prospects to be solid, surpassinginflation over time. Expectations for ongoing business investment and populationgrowth, and the strong performance of key trade and tourism markets support thisview. The county also retains considerable independent revenue raisingauthority, particularly ad valorem taxes within the context of statutory millagerate caps. Expenditure Framework: 'a' Fitch expects ongoing spending pressures from rising service demands and laborcosts coupled with increases in contributions to health and transit operationswithin maintenance-of-effort formulas. These factors temper an otherwisemanageable level of fixed costs associated with debt and pension payments andfairly strong level of control over staffing and collective bargainingimpasse/dispute resolution. Long-Term Liability Burden:  'aa' Long-term liabilities are expected to remain moderate given growth in theeconomic resource base, which should help accommodate a likely increase in debtto fund the county's considerable capital plan. Pension liabilities are mostlydriven by the county's participation in the state-administered FloridaRetirement System (FRS) and are not expected to pressure the assessment. Operating Performance:  'aa' The county maintains an adequate level of unrestricted reserves and high legalauthority to raise revenue, which together underpin its very strong capacity tomanage risks inherent in a cyclical downturn. The 'aa' operating performanceassessment assumes the county will maintain unrestricted resources at or nearthe policy requirement of 7% of the general fund budget, and avoid budgetmanagement practices that resulted in a weakening of financial resources to aslow as 4% of spending during the Great Recession. RATING SENSITIVITIES Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects the county will address future budgetarygaps largely through recurring actions and limited reliance on reserves andother one-time actions. Results contrary to this expectation could pressure theoperating performance assessment and the GO, IDR and NAV-supported ratings. ECONOMIC RESOURCE BASE Miami-Dade continues to experience solid population and economic growth. Thecounty's 2018 population is estimated at 2.76 million - an increase of nearly11% from the 2010 Census, which modestly trails the rate of population growthstatewide over the same period. A large segment of the county's economy isdriven by the leisure and hospitality sector. Construction, trade andtransportation are the other mainstays of the economy. Economic challengescenter on affordable housing, transit and vulnerability to disruption viaextreme weather events. Resident median household income is below the statebenchmark and the county's individual poverty rate is moderately elevated. Thecounty's tax base is performing well, notwithstanding these pressure points, astaxable assessed value (TAV) for fiscal 2019 is up more than 6% from the prioryear and 50% in aggregate since fiscal 2013. Median home prices in Miami-DadeCounty, as reported by Zillow Group, are more than $300,000 or about 130% of thestate norm. IDR CREDIT PROFILE Revenue Framework Property taxes remain the largest funding source for government operations,accounting for 55% of general fund revenue and transfers in during fiscal 2018followed by service charges and intergovernmental at 15% and 12%, respectively.Intergovernmental revenue largely represents the county's proportionate share ofthe state local government half-cent sales tax (LGST) and other state revenuesharing receipts. Looking forward, Fitch would expect general fund revenue growth, absent policyaction, to be slightly above the level of inflation given forecasts forpopulation, employment and income growth in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West PalmBeach MSA. Over time, cyclical and non-cyclical revenue volatility due to shiftsin the housing market, tourism and/or weather-related events, for example, isexpected to temper strong growth through economic upswings. At present, generalfund revenues are performing very well registering annual growth of 3.7% infiscal 2014, 5.9% in fiscal 2015, 4.5% in fiscal 2016, 6.0% in fiscal 2017 and10.2% in fiscal 2018, largely driven by growth in the county's tax base. Thecounty is forecasting continued strong tax base and ad valorem revenue growth,but more moderate increases for various non-ad valorem revenues in part due topressure on disposable personal incomes given the increase pressure on homeprices and residential rental rates. The county retains a high level of legal authority to increase revenues inrelation to the potential revenue volatility it may experience through economiccycles. The non-voted general operating millage rate adopted for fiscal 2019 was7.37 mills compared with a statutory limit of 10 mills. The county estimates itsadditional capacity under the 10-mill cap could have generated approximately$724 million of additional ad valorem revenue in fiscal 2019 for regionalservices. The county also has a separate 10-mill limitation applicable to theunincorporated municipal service area (UMSA). Roughly 1.2 million residents, orapproximately 43% of the county's total population, reside within the UMSA;these residents pay a separate property tax for 'municipal' services provided bythe county. The county estimates it can generate approximately $589 million inadditional ad valorem revenue for UMSA services. The county's ad valorem revenueraising capacity is very high when considered in the context of its general fundrevenue budget of text of its property tax (compared with general fund revenues- countywide and USMA - of approximately $2.1 billion in fiscal 2019). Annual changes in the millage rate are determined using a rolled-back or revenueneutral rate adjusted for changes in Florida per capita personal income;however, this limitation may be overridden by vote of the county governing body.The county also retains an independent legal authority to increase certain feeand service charge revenues, which account for a smaller percentage of totalrevenue. Expenditure Framework As noted above, Miami-Dade County provides certain local services to residentswithin the USMA in addition to regional or countywide services such as publichealth and social services, recreation, transportation, and regional sheriffservices and jails via its general fund budget. Fire rescue operating servicesare accounted for as a separate governmental fund type and principally fundedfrom a portion of the countywide ad valorem tax rate. On a combined basis,public safety spending accounted for approximately 53% of general fund and firerescue fund spending in fiscal 2018. Spending levels are expected to track changes in population and inflation and togenerally align with the pace of revenue growth as has been the case in recenthistory. Growth-driven service demands are typically offset by higher ad valoremand non-ad valorem revenue. Spending pressures may become increasingly acute incertain areas, particularly transportation and debt service. Miami-Dade County retains an adequate capacity to adjust spending levelsthroughout the economic cycle. The county retains legal control to adjust thesize of its workforce, which it amply demonstrated during the last recession.Employee wages and benefits are subject to collective bargaining; however, thecounty is not at risk to binding arbitration - under state law, if an impasse isdeclared, both parties are required to engage in a mediation process after whichthe county may impose contract terms for one year. The county's collectivebargaining units are currently operating under three-year contracts that expireat the end of fiscal 2020. The cost of funding annual debt service and retiree benefits consumedapproximately 15% of governmental spending in fiscal 2018, which Fitch views asmoderate. Debt service costs may continue to slowly ramp-up given the county'slarge capital program and slow payout of existing debt, but Fitch expects theoverall burden of these fixed obligations to remain within the moderate range.Fitch views the county's support for operations for the Miami-Dadetransportation Department (MDT) and Jackson Memorial Hospital (JMH) as potentialadditional spending pressures. General fund transfers to MDT and JMHapproximated $190 million and $189 million, respectively, in fiscal 2018 or acombined 10% of governmental spending. The transfers to MDT and JMH are based onseparate maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirements -- the MDT transfer escalatesat 3.5% annually whereas the JMH transfer is based on a millage equivalent of0.6667 mills and a percentage of certain general fund revenues per state law. MDT contributions above the MOE amount are discretionary but expected tocontinue to help offset continuing transit fare losses and fund increased debtservice and capital costs. Additionally, the county plans to eliminate itscurrent practice of applying a portion of the proceeds of a half-cent transitsurtax (about $95 million in fiscal 2019) to fund transit operating costs overthe next five years, replacing such funding with alternative revenue sources,including property taxes. Long-Term Liability Burden Long-term liabilities associated with direct and overlapping debt and retireepension benefits remain stable at an estimated 12% of the county's totalpersonal income. In Fitch's view, a material portion of Miami-Dade County'sresource base is excluded from its total personal income given the degree ofeconomic activity driven by non-residents. The 'aa' assessment reflects Fitch'sexpectation that the county's long-term liabilities will likely increase in theintermediate term, as the county continues to advance a sizable capitalimprovement plan while repaying its outstanding debt at a slow pace (roughly 34%within 10 years). Direct debt is the largest single component of the long-termliability burden, approximating $6 billion (general obligation and othergovernmental obligations) or 4.7% of personal income. General government capital needs identified through 2023 total $4.7 billion(excluding aviation, water and sewer, solid waste and other enterprise supportedactivities). The capital plan is expected to be financed mostly through theissuance of additional debt and lease obligations; however, Fitch believes thecounty will likely modify the timing and execution of its capital plan to alignclosely with available resources. Fitch also expects continued growth inpersonal income and population -- which have risen by 20.4% and 10.6%,respectively, since 2010 -- to help offset the increase in liabilities. The county's Fitch-adjusted net pension liability (NPL) registers just under 4%of personal income (Fitch creates a standardized investment return scenario,estimating the NPL with a 6% investment return assumption adjustment for pensionliabilities calculated with a discount rate at a higher level). The bulk of theNPL is derived from the county's participation in the state-administered FloridaRetirement System (FRS). The Fitch-adjusted ratio of fiduciary net position(FNP) to total pension liability (TPL) for FRS is 84% as of the July 1, 2018valuation date. The county makes an actuarially-based required contribution toFRS as established by the state legislature. The county also administers aseparate single employer defined benefit plan for employees of the Public HealthTrust (PHT) (Jackson Memorial Hospital). The county fully funds the actuarialdetermined contribution to the PHT plan, which has a Fitch-adjusted net pensionliability and ratio of FNP to TPL of approximately $167 million and 83%,respectively, as of the Sept. 30, 2018 measurement date. Operating Performance Fitch views the county's inherent budget flexibility as high based on thestrength of its legal authority to increase property tax and other servicecharges and fee revenues relative to potential revenue stress in a moderateeconomic downturn (a 2.7% decline in year 1 via FAST). Expenditure flexibilityis viewed as adequate, with strong legal control over employee-related pressuresand moderate existing debt and retiree benefit costs tempered by rising MOErequirements to MDT and JMH. The county's capacity to respond to cyclical stressis supported by its reserve position, which has been maintained at a solid levelin recent years. Fitch calculates available general fund reserves at $333million in fiscal 2018 or nearly 14% of spending. Available general fund reserves were drawn to a low 4% of spending in fiscal2009-2010 due to pressures associated with the recession and severe tax basedeclines. Reserves have ranged from 10%-14% of spending since. The county hasproduced consecutive years of operating surplus in the general fund from fiscal2015-2018 reflecting healthier economic and revenue conditions, but also moreconservative forecasting. The county's current five-year financial outlookdepicts surplus results through fiscal 2024 on a combined countywide and UMSAbasis. Key revenue assumptions include annual growth in ad valorem taxes from4.9%-5.3% (based on a constant millage rate) and 3.5% in sales tax. The outlookreflects current service levels, funding for collective bargaining agreements,and increases in employee health care and worker's compensation costs tomaintain required reserves in the self-insurance fund. Demonstration of thecounty's commitment to maintain fiscal balance through the next economicdownturn without depleting its fund balance position could portend considerationof positive rating movement. DEDICATED TAX KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating on the PSFFT revenue bonds is based on the creditworthiness derivedfrom the NAV covenant, which Fitch views as stronger than the rating suggestedby a dedicated tax analysis. Fiscal 2018 pledged dedicated taxes cover annualdebt service (ADS) by about 3.6x. However, ADS rises by roughly 5% per annumuntil MADS of $71.1 million in fiscal 2048, and coverage of MADS from fiscal2018 pledged revenues is only 0.6x. Fitch's view of the structure's coveragecushion is further constrained by the high level of volatility inherent in thepledged dedicated taxes. DEDICATED TAX CREDIT PROFILE Pledged revenues increased by 18% in fiscal 2018 to a total of $45 million. Thestrong growth in fiscal 2018 follows a flat year-over-year performance in fiscal2017 due to weakness in the tourism industry following the Zika virus outbreak.Miami-Dade's abundance of leisure and vacation attractions, its broad businesscommunity and convention events, and access to cruise ports and culturalcenters, among other factors, support Fitch's expectation for continued stronggrowth. Additionally, there continues to be ongoing investment from the privatesector in hotel properties and high room inventories, supporting the strongvisitor demand. Pledged revenues have increased at a 10-year CAGR of 5% throughfiscal 2018. Despite its strong track record of growth Fitch views the PSFFT'shistory of acute volatility as a credit risk, evidenced in single-year declinesof 19% and 16% in fiscal 2009 and 2002, respectively. Fiscal 2018 pledged revenues totaling $45 million were equivalent to nearly 3.6xannual debt service (ADS) of $12.6 million on the year. The PSFFT structurefeatures steadily ascending debt service scheduling, which rises by a CAGR of5.2% annually to maximum annual debt service (MADS) of $71.1 million in fiscal2048. Fitch's dedicated tax analysis focuses on the coverage of MADS, which wasonly 0.6x from fiscal 2018 pledged revenues. Fitch estimates the pledgeddedicated taxes would need to grow by about 1.6% annually to cover MADS at 1.0x. Given the thin coverage of MADS from pledged revenues, Fitch's rating analysisfocuses on the county's NAV covenant to cure a deficiency in pledged revenues.The rating also considers a provision in the bond ordinance that allows for, butdoes not require, the release of the NAV covenant upon achievement of 1.5x MADScoverage from pledged dedicated taxes in two successive fiscal years. AlthoughFitch considers this unlikely in the foreseeable future based on the significantgap between ADS and MADS, the agency views the potential release of the NAVcovenant as an additional risk feature, resulting in a two-notch ratingdistinction between the rating on the bonds and the county IDR of 'AA'.

"(Adds details, background) BERLIN, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Senior German conservative lawmaker Norbert Roettgen has put himself forward as a surprise candidate to take over as leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), further complicating the party's chaotic succession planning. Last week, Annegret-Kramp Karrenbauer, Merkel's protegee, threw the party into turmoil by saying she would not stand as chancellor in the next federal election, due by Oct. 2021, and announcing that she would give up the CDU party chair. Roettgen's unexpected move makes him the fourth contender for the post of party leader. Roettgen has something of a national profile due to his role as head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee but is not seen as a big hitter in the party. He also served as an environment minister under Merkel from 2009 to 2012. Roettgen has in the past been seen as someone who could work with the Greens, currently the second-biggest party in polls after the conservative bloc. In a letter quoted by the regional newspaper Rheinische Post to outgoing CDU leader Kramp-Karrenbauer, Roettgen said the situation was ""so serious that it was about the future of the CDU and what that meant for the stability of Germany"". The other CDU leadership contenders are Friedrich Merz, a former archrival to Merkel who is an economic liberal, right-wing health minister Jens Spahn and Armin Laschet, premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state. A centrist, Laschet is seen as a continuity candidate. The CDU leader is likely to be chancellor candidate for the conservative bloc but the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party to the CDU - could also put forward a candidate.

"By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - Women who eat lots of fruits and vegetables may experience fewer physical and mental health symptoms of menopause than those who prefer to dine on sweets, fats and snacks, an Iranian study suggests. Researchers surveyed 400 women who had already gone through menopause about their eating habits as well as their recollection of how often they experienced symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, muscle and joint problems and bladder issues. The study team also identified three distinct eating patterns: some women's diets were abundant in fruits and vegetables; others consumed plenty of mayonnaise, oils, sweets and desserts; and a third group favored a wide variety of fatty foods and snacks. Then, researchers sorted women into groups according to how closely they adhered to one of these three dietary patterns. Compared to women who consumed the fewest fruits and vegetables, women who had the most greens in their diets found menopause had a much smaller impact on their general wellbeing and physical and mental health. By contrast, women who ate the most fatty foods and snacks were much more likely to suffer menopause symptoms that impaired their quality of life and impacted their physical and mental health than those who ate the most greens. ""The high-fat and -sugar dietary pattern has high amounts of simple carbohydrates and unhealthy fats, especially saturated and trans fats, and a relatively low content of fiber, which can increase the levels of inflammatory biomarkers and body weight, all of them are related to menopausal symptoms,"" said senior study author Gity Sotoudeh of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. ""On the other hand, fruits and vegetables are low in fat, are a good source of micronutrients, antioxidants, as they help the body to lower the inflammation and maintain a healthy body weight during the menopause,"" Sotoudeh said by email. ""Fruits and vegetables are also rich in fiber, which can modify the estrogen metabolism and decrease the fluctuation in levels of estrogen, which all decrease the risk of symptoms."" Women go through menopause when they stop menstruating, typically between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward, women can experience symptoms ranging from vaginal dryness to mood swings, joint pain and insomnia. Obesity, inactivity, smoking and alcohol consumption have all been linked to an increased risk of more severe or frequent menopause symptoms, the study authors write in the journal Menopause. Some previous research has also linked diets low in fat and high in whole grains, fruits and vegetables with fewer hot flashes and night sweats, the authors also note. In the current study, participants were in typically in their mid- to late-50s and had gone through menopause around 7 to 9 years earlier. They were generally obese or overweight, and most were married, widowed or divorced. The study can't prove whether or how specific eating habits might directly impact menopause symptoms. Another limitation is that the group of women in the study was too small to draw broad conclusions about how diet might influence menopause symptoms, the researchers note. Still, eating fats and sweets in moderation can have other health benefits, Sotoudeh said. ""We suggest that women cut down or avoid fast food, sweet and sugary food as much as they can, and start adding foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, especially colorful and green leafy vegetables and whole grain into their diet if they are not getting enough of them,"" Sotoudeh advised. ""Because it not only helps them to have lower menopausal symptoms, it would help with preventing of weight gain and some diseases that menopausal women are at a higher risk of.""

"By Dasha Afanasieva LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Africa-focused private equity firm DPI has bought a fifth of Moroccan foam mattress company Dolidol, DPI said on Thursday, in a bet on the continent's growing middle classes. DPI paid around $30 million for the 20 percent stake in Dolidol, which was founded in 1972 and manufactures and sells polyurethane foam, mattresses, sofas and non-woven textiles. The partnership with DPI will allow Dolidol to expand in sub Saharan Africa with an emphasis on West Africa, DPI said in a statement. DPI, which has more than $1.1 billion in assets under management, has invested around $230 million across five investments in Morocco. While Morocco sidestepped the uprisings that upended much of the Arab world in 2011, it has seen protests driven by poverty and unemployment erupt more recently in some neglected regions. GDP growth is expected to slow to 2.9 percent in 2019 from a forecast 3.1 percent this year, an official said in August. ""We are predicting that the market (Morocco) will perform strongly in the years to come, underpinned by strong macro-growth, a low deficit and modest debt levels,"" DPI Partner Sofiane Lahmar said. ""While there are a number of opportunities across Africa, the biggest opportunity is undoubtedly the sizable and growing middle-class.

"By Jessica DiNapoli Oct 2 (Reuters) - Mattress Firm Inc, the largest U.S. mattress retailer, is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection as soon as this week as it seek to exit costly store leases and shore up its business as retailers struggle, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The Houston-based retailer, with 3,000 brick-and-mortar locations, has been squeezed by online upstarts including Casper Sleep Inc. Mattress Firm's South African parent company, Steinhoff International Holdings NV, faces its own debt challenges. Mattress Firm and Steinhoff did not respond to multiple requests seeking comment. Once Mattress Firm files for bankruptcy, the process is expected to be completed within a couple of months, and Mattress Firm's vendors are expected to be repaid in full, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media on the matter. Mattress Firm would shed some of its stores in the process, the sources said. Steinhoff acquired Mattress Firm for $3.8 billion in 2016. Mattress Firm had acquired HMK Mattress Holdings LLC, the parent company of competitor Sleepy's, the same year for $780 million and then rebranded the shops. More than 20 retailers have filed bankruptcy since the beginning of 2017. Toys ""R"" Us Inc did not survive and liquidated, while others including children's retailer Gymboree Corp and Payless ShoeSource Inc reorganized. Analysts at Piper Jaffray Companies said last summer that a bankruptcy would allow Mattress Firm to clean up its real estate portfolio and improve cash flow and profitability. Mattress Firm lost Tempur Sealy International Inc, the maker of mattress brand Tempur-Pedic, as a supplier last year, limiting its offerings. Steinhoff is a retail conglomerate that sells furniture, household goods and general merchandise in Europe, Africa and Australia, and it has automotive dealerships in South Africa. In July, creditors agreed to hold debt claims for three years, removing a threat of default. Steinhoff, which has more than 40 brands that include Conforama, Mattress Firm and Poundland, has sold assets including its Polish unit Kika/Leiner and stakes in investment holding firm PSG and industrial firm KAP.

"* A look at the day ahead from European Economics andPoliticsEditor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The viewsexpressed are their own. LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - Boris Johnson and his team aretrying to move on from some of the question marks over hispremiership campaign, re-focusing  in a BBC interview on hispromise to pull the UK out of the EU at all costs on Oct 31. Yeta report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank hasmeanwhile shed an unfavourable light on his main domesticpolicy, notably a raft of tax cuts that will predominantlybenefit high-earners. The study calculated the moves could costas much as 20 billion pounds ($25 billion) a year and questionedwhether they were compatible with balancing the budget and inany way ""prudent"". It's hard to say whether such assertions willresonate among Conservative voters who will in the main benefitfrom such moves; it's also true that Johnson's rival Jeremy Huntis proposing tax cuts, in his case aimed at business. It looks as if the showdown between Brussels and Rome overItaly's debt won't happen any time soon. The European Commissioncould give Italy until January to make fiscal policy changesunder an EU debt procedure, minutes of an EU meeting show, amove that would set a relatively long deadline to help avertfines and any backlash from Rome's eurosceptics. Deputy PrimeMinister Luigi Di Maio was quoted this morning as saying the EUwould in any case allow Italy to increase its deficit if ithelped the country's economy. The EU executive is expected topropose next week that the disciplinary procedure be launched. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of Britain's FinancialConduct Authority, faces questions from lawmakers today aboutthe suspension of an investment fund by former star manager NeilWoodford. Given that Baily is a front-runner in the race to bethe next governor of the Bank of England, the hearing will beread by many as a de facto audition for the BoE job, whichcurrent occupant Mark Carney is due to vacate next February. MARKETS AT 0655 GMT Before we get to the G20 festival of bilateral summits thisweekend, world markets have to go through a quick reality checkon whether they have gauged the U.S. Federal Reserve’ssignalling correctly. With more than a 25 basis point rate cutnow priced for next month and a further two by yearend, Fedchair Powell’s speech later on Tuesday will either protest thataggressive pricing or validate it. Against a constant barragefrom U.S. President Trump that the Fed “blew it” and doesn’tknow what its doing, Powell had the unenviable task of stressingthe bank independence while not being seen to be simply bow tomarket and White House pressure. The risk at this stage is thateven a quarter point cut in July will now disappoint everyone.The dollar continues to weaken into the speech, however, withits DXY index dropping for the sixth straight day to its lowestin three months. With tensions over Washington’s new sanctionsover Iran and nervousness that the G20 meeting on trade betweenTrump and China’s President Xi will get nowhere, there was aclear ‘safety bid’ for the likes of gold, Japan’s yen and theSwiss franc. Dollar/yen fell below 107 for the first time sinceJanuary’s flash crash, while dollar/franc fell to its lowest innine months. Gold prices, which have climbed more than 10% in a month,continued to soar to 6-month highs on a mix of geopolitical andtrade tensions plus the recent collapse of global cash and bondyields that has seen the universe of negative yielding debt riseabove $13 trillion, with more than half of all the euro zonegovernment bonds now with sub-zero yields. What’s more, therecent moves by major central banks to signal further easing hasseen both stocks and bonds move higher in tandem – a worryingcorrelation that has prompted many investors to seek greaterdiversification in the likes of gold and alternative assets.With safety at a premium, U.S. 10 year Treasury yields continuedto push lower. Wall St stocks stayed shy of last week’s newrecords – closing in the red on Monday. Shanghai and HK stocksfell more than 1% overnight, hurt by White House signals thatTrump is “comfortable” with any outcome from the weekend tradetalks. Hit by the stronger yen, Japan’s Nikkei was down almost0.5% and Seoul was in the red too. U.S. and European stockfutures were also lower.

"(Adds guidance, CEO comment, background) Aug 23 (Reuters) - Santos Ltd, Australia's second-largest independent gas producer, reported on Thursday a near doubling in first-half underlying profit and revived its dividend, scrapped more than two years ago, after slashing debt. Underlying profit for the half-year ended June 30 rose to $217 million from $109 million a year earlier, beating a forecast of $189 million from Royal Bank of Canada. Santos declared an interim dividend of $0.035 a share. It suspended dividends in 2016, diverting cash to pay down debt which peaked for the construction of its Gladstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project just as oil prices collapsed. The turnaround in fortunes followed Santos' rejection in May of a $10.8 billion takeover offer from private equity-backed Harbour Energy, with the board having bet instead on the company's growth strategy in Australia and Papua New Guinea. ""We will shortly achieve our net debt reduction target, more than a year ahead of schedule, and therefore have a significantly stronger balance sheet to support our growth strategy,"" Chief Executive Officer Kevin Gallagher said in a statement. Santos agreed on Wednesday to buy Quadrant Energy for $2.15 billion and gain access to what may be the biggest oil find off Western Australia in over two decades. Santos cut net debt to $2.44 billion in the first half, in line with its plan to reduce net debt to below $2 billion by the end of 2018, thanks to sharp cost-cutting and a rebound in oil and gas prices. The company maintained its 2018 production of 55-58 million barrels of oil on growing output from its Cooper Basin assets. Santos said this month a fourth gas rig had started operations at the site in South Australia. Production in the first half was hurt by a six-week outage at the PNG LNG operation, run by ExxonMobil Corp, following an earthquake in Papua New Guinea's rugged highlands. The company also maintained its 2018 sales volume guidance of 72-76 mmboe.

"(Adds statistics on hotel bookings on Airbnb, paragraph 8) By Heather Somerville SAN FRANCISCO, March 7 (Reuters) - Home-renting companyAirbnb has bought HotelTonight, an app for finding hotel roomsat a discount, as it wades deeper into the hotel-bookingbusiness to attract a wider variety of travelers ahead of ahotly anticipated initial public offering. The acquisition, which Airbnb announced on Thursday, expandsthe company's inventory by adding a number of listings fromhotels, long viewed as the arch enemy of Airbnb, and is part ofa strategy to win over travelers who have shied away from therisks and quirks of renting a stranger's home. The bid to become a one-stop travel service for moremainstream sightseers puts Airbnb more squarely in competitionwith large travel sites such as Expedia Group Inc andPriceline. Airbnb declined to provide the terms of the deal. HotelTonight has raised more than $115 million in fundingand was last valued at $463 million in a funding around in 2017. Airbnb Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky called theacquisition ""a big part of building an end-to-end travelplatform."" Airbnb has steadily moved into new businesses outsideof homes, whose growth is threatened by regulations that capshort-term rentals. The company has added guided tours and activities, luxuryhomes and restaurant reservations and is pursuing addingtransportation services. Early last year, it made changes to itssite to make it easier for boutique hotels andbed-and-breakfasts to list their rooms. In 2018, Airbnb more than doubled the number of availablerooms in hotels, resorts, hostels and similar venues. As aresult, the company had three times the number of hotel roombookings in 2018 compared to 2017, often by first-time Airbnbusers, the company said. And more people are booking Airbnbrooms or homes at the last-minute, many of them businesstravelers, the company said. Last-minute booking is HotelTonight's sweet spot. The SanFrancisco-based company culls unsold inventory from hotels andoffers discounted rooms to travelers, often targeting businessdistricts and urban areas. It started as a service for same-dayroom bookings, but now lets users book months in advance. Although the company has struggled to stand out from thetravel-booking giants, HotelTonight is profitable. It spent muchof 2016 cutting losses through layoffs and eliminating costlypromotions to go from burning $2 million to $3 million eachmonth to earning a profit, CEO and Co-founder Sam Shank toldReuters. But it faced immense pressure from investors to grow ina crowded industry. HotelTonight's listings include large hotel chains such asSheraton and Hyatt that Airbnb has said will not have aplace on its site. Airbnb and HotelTonight will operate asseparate entities, Airbnb said, with HotelTonight keeping itsown app and website. Over time, Airbnb will add select boutiqueHotelTonight rooms, but will not change its standards for hotellistings.

"* Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon hit record highs * CA shares surge on Broadcom's buyout deal * Industrials bounce back after Wednesday's slide * Steady economic data also bolsters sentiment * Indexes up: Dow 0.9 pct, S&P 0.8 pct, Nasdaq 1.3 pct (Updates to late afternoon) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Thursday as top technology names hit record highs and industrials rebounded, offsetting worries about a U.S.-China trade war. Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon hit all-time intraday highs and along with Apple and Alphabet powered the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. The technology index rose 1.6 percent, the day's best-performing sector, and the group is now leading year-to-date gains among sectors. Industrials rose 1.1 percent, while the defensive utilities sector, which had outperformed recently, was down 0.1 percent. Helping the tech sector is the view that those companies may be more immune to potential trade dispute problems, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. But also, she said, ""The consensus is that negotiations will resume and there will be some sort of agreement between the U.S. and China. It could be naive, but that seems to be an emerging consensus within the market."" The United States late Tuesday threatened to impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China said on Thursday the two countries have not been in touch about restarting talks and while it does not want a trade war, it would fight if necessary. Boeing and Caterpillar, among the hardest hit by the recent trade dispute, rose, boosting the Dow. Within tech, CA Inc jumped 18.3 percent after chipmaker Broadcom announced a surprise $18.9-billion deal to buy the business software company. Broadcom slumped 14 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 204.44 points, or 0.83 percent, to 24,904.89, the S&P 500 gained 21.84 points, or 0.79 percent, to 2,795.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 98.70 points, or 1.28 percent, to 7,815.31. Weekly jobless claims hit a two-month low last week, the Labor Department said, in a sign that labor market conditions remained robust in early July. The consumer price index barely rose in June, but the underlying trend continued to point to a steady buildup of inflation pressure that could keep the Federal Reserve on a path of gradual interest rate increases. Reporting of quarterly earnings picks up steam on Friday with the big Wall Street banks, and overall S&P 500 companies are expected to post second-quarter profit growth of around 21 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Delta Air Lines rose 1.6 percent, and lifted other airline stocks, after the carrier's quarterly profit topped estimates on higher average fares. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

"(Compares with estimates, adds details, share movement) Oct 17 (Reuters) - Top U.S. aluminum producer Alcoa Corp reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, as a series of supply hits boosted alumina prices. Shares of Alcoa rose 3 percent to $37.79 in after-hours trading, also helped by the announcement of a $200 million share repurchase program. Alumina prices spiked during the year, largely due  to supply disruptions such as lower production at Norsk Hydro's Alunorte, the world's largest alumina refinery, a strike at Alcoa's Australian operations and U.S. sanctions on Russian aluminum giant Rusal. Alcoa also tightened its 2018 adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) forecast to range between $3.1 billion and $3.2 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion. Net loss attributable to Alcoa was $41 million, or 22 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $113 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. The results include a charge of $160 million mainly due to a non-cash charge from the transfer of certain of its U.S. pension and retirement benefits. Revenue rose 14.4 percent to $3.39 billion. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 63 cents per share. Analysts on average expected a profit of 36 cents per share and revenue of $3.31 billion, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window) * Futures up: Dow 0.94%, S&P 500 0.97%, Nasdaq 1.13% By Shreyashi   Sanyal Oct 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose strongly on Friday, as hopes grew for a partial trade deal and a delay in scheduled U.S. tariff increases, as top negotiators from the United States and China geared up to meet for a second day of talks. Early market action showed Wall Street's three main indexes were headed for their third straight day of gains, after ending the previous session on optimism that the two sides could cool off their row before more U.S. tariffs kick in next week. President Donald Trump said trade talks between the U.S. and Chinese officials on Thursday went well, and is set to meet Chinese Vice Premier Liu He later in the day. Still, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes were set for their fourth straight weekly fall, with risk appetite recently taking a hit from weak economic data and headlines about the U.S.-China trade war. Chipmakers, which are heavily exposed to China, rose steadily in premarket trading. Intel Corp, Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc all rose about 1.5%, while Apple Inc gained 1.3%. Wedbush hiked its price target for shares of the iPhone maker, as the brokerage remained bullish on the official launch of the company's Apple TV+ video streaming service. Other gainers included oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, which rose 1.1% and 0.6%, respectively as a report of an attack on an Iranian oil tanker lifted oil prices. At 7:16 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 248 points, or 0.94%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 28.5 points, or 0.97% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 88 points, or 1.13%. Focus will shift to earnings next week as market participants brace for the impact of the trade war on Corporate America. Analysts are expecting a 3.1% drop in earnings for the third quarter from a year ago, based on IBES data from Refinitiv, and that could mark the first decline since 2016. Investors are also betting on a third interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve by the end of the month, to battle an economic downturn in the world's largest economy.

"By Jim Christie (Reuters) - Bankrupt health products maker Aceto Corp onFriday sought a court order approving its plan to sell itsgeneric drug business for $12.3 million in cash and theassumption of liabilities that may exceed $125 million. In a motion seeking approval of its bidding procedures fromJudge Vincent Papalia of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for theDistrict of New Jersey, Aceto said Shore Suven Pharma Inc hadoffered to buy its Rising Pharmaceuticals Inc genericsubsidiary. Shore Suven's offer is a stalking-horse bid that will put afloor on other bids that may emerge by March 29. An auction willbe held on April 2 if other offers are received, Aceto said. Terms of the stalking-horse agreement were finalized onThursday, less than a month after Aceto sought Chapter 11bankruptcy protection, the filing added. Port Washington, New York-headquartered Aceto filed forChapter 11 protection with another agreement to sell itschemicals business assets for $338 million to NMC Atlas LP, anaffiliate of investment firm New Mountain Capital. Aceto had been facing pressure from adverse conditions inthe generic drug market and ran into supply chain problems andcharges stemming from some generic products falling out ofcompliance with country-of-origin terms in government supplycontracts, according to the company's court papers. The challenges weighed on Aceto's ability to comply withloan terms, so the company, which has about $349 million incombined loans and notes, began looking for buyers for itsassets. Aceto said it had considered liquidating Rising butdetermined the deal with Shore Suven was a better option for itscreditors. Shore Suven is a joint venture of India-based Suven LifeSciences Ltd, an outsourced research and manufacturing firm, andShore Pharma Investments LLC, an investment vehicle led by Acetoboard member Vimal Kavuru. According to Aceto's motion, Kavuru has not taken part inboard meetings since November and was not involved talks aboutthe Rising sale. Aceto was not available for further comment. The case is In re Aceto Corp et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,District of New Jersey, No. 19-13448.

"By Ali Sawafta KHAN AL-AHMAR, West Bank, Sept 11 (Reuters) - When the residents of Khan al-Ahmar awoke on Tuesday morning,  they were greeted by the sight of five brand new shacks on the outskirts of their village, a cluster of tumbledown huts on a desert hillside in the occupied West Bank. The structures are the work of dozens of Palestinian activists who have come to protest against Israel's plan to demolish Khan al-Ahmar and relocate its 180 residents - Bedouins who scrape a living by raising sheep and goats - to a site 12 km (7 miles) away. Organised by activists from several rights groups and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, the protest action comes a day before a temporary injunction that had put the demolition on hold is due to expire. ""We are just waiting to see if they are going to come tonight and expel us and demolish the houses,"" said Feisal Abu Dahok, 45, a resident of the village. ""We will not leave voluntarily. If they throw us out we will return to stay in this place. There is no other place for us to go."" Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Britain have followed the European Union and the United Nations in urging Israel not to demolish Khan al-Ahmar, citing the serious impact on the community and prospects for peace. But last week Israel's Supreme Court rejected petitions to prevent the move, siding with the authorities which say the village was built without the required permits. Palestinians say such documents are impossible to obtain. PALESTINIAN APPEAL TO ICC The Palestinian leadership has submitted an appeal to the International Criminal Court to intervene, senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said on Tuesday. ""It included the focus on the war crimes facing Khan al-Ahmar, specifically the crimes of forceable displacement, ethnic cleansing and destruction of civilian property,"" Erekat told reporters. Khan al-Ahmar lies beside an Israeli highway that runs through the West Bank from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea. Palestinians say the demolition is part of an Israeli push to create an arc of settlements that would effectively cut off East Jerusalem from the West Bank, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which the Palestinians seek for an independent state. Israel has not said whether it plans to build a settlement on the site after demolition. Most countries consider settlements in the West Bank as illegal and an obstacle to peace. They say they reduce and fragment the territory Palestinians seek for a viable state. Israel disputes this and cites biblical, historical and political connections to the land, as well as security needs. Home to members of the Bedouin Jahalin tribe, which the military expelled from southern Israel in the 1950s, Khan al-Ahmar sits between a major Israeli settlement, Maale Adumim, and a smaller one to the northeast, Kfar Adumim. Visible on the hills on the other side of a barren, rock-strewn valley, Kfar Adumim's white-washed apartment blocks and tree-lined roads lie in stark contrast to the ramshackle wood and tin huts of the Bedouins. Israel plans to relocate the community to an area near the Palestinian village of Abu Dis. The new site is adjacent to a landfill and rights advocates say that a forcible transfer of the residents would violate international law applying to occupied territory. Israeli authorities could not be reached for comment on Tuesday - the second day of the Jewish new year holiday. Helped by some of the villagers and working quickly under the cover of darkness, the activists assembled the shacks in time for sunrise. Some were flying the Palestinian flag. ""It is our right as Palestinians to live in these lands,"" said one protester, Mohammed al-Khatib.

"BEIRUT, July 9 (Reuters) - Lebanon's tourism minister urgedpoliticians on Tuesday not to wreck the country's best touristseason in years, after a deadly shooting in a popular mountainregion stirred fears of strife. Avedis Guidanian said more tourists came to Lebanon in thefirst half of this year than in the same period any year since2010. But he warned the president in a meeting that the summerforecast would take a hit if political tensions persisted. ""I told him, in case this incident cannot be contained,there are fears. There are many questions from people planningto come,"" the minister told a press conference at thepresidential palace. He added that there were no big cancellations so far. ""His excellency (President Michel Aoun) assured me thatthings are on the right track. God willing, soon, we will havereally overcome this."" The government has vowed to restore security after theshootout on July 1 killed two aides of a minister in the Choufmountains, one of the bloodiest theatres of Lebanon's 1975-90civil war. The tourism industry, once a mainstay of Lebanon'snow-battered economy, has been in the doldrums since 2011 - theyear conflict erupted in neighbouring Syria. Political paralysis in Lebanon and travel warnings from GulfArab states also added to the sector's woes. The slump in tourism has played a part in years of weakeconomic growth and a hike in the huge public debt, which thegovernment now pledges tough reforms to bring under control. As relations with Gulf Arab states and security improved,officials including Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri have predicteda promising summer for tourism this year. ""The numbers of people travelling to Lebanon in first sixmonths of 2019 are very encouraging,"" Guidanian said on Tuesday. More people were arriving from Europe and Gulf statesincluding Saudi Arabia, which lifted its travel warning againstcitizens going to Lebanon this year, the minister said.

"* IMF warns of heightening risks to fast-growing Asia * G20 chair Japan warns of downside risks to global growth * G20 members must use all tools available -Japan's Aso (Recasts with comments from G20 chair Japan) By Leika Kihara and David Lawder WASHINGTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Policymakers from the world's major economies on Friday warned that risks posed by trade and geopolitical tensions could slow already-weakening global economic growth, but offered little beyond calls for using all available tools to prevent recession. The International Monetary Fund also said the U.S.-China trade war and slumping Chinese demand were heightening risks to Asia, the world's fastest-growing region, adding to signs of a darkening global outlook. ""Headwinds from global policy uncertainty and growth deceleration in major trading partners are taking a toll on manufacturing, investment, trade, and growth,"" Changyong Rhee, director of the IMF's Asia and Pacific department, said during a news conference at the IMF and World Bank fall meetings. ""The intensification in trade tensions between the U.S. and China could further weigh on confidence and financial markets, thereby weakening trade, investment and growth,"" he said. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who chaired the two-day meeting of Group of 20 finance leaders, said while the global economy continues to expand, the pace of growth was slowing. ""For global growth, the balance of risk remains tilted to the downside, particularly with the further escalation of trade and geopolitical tensions,"" Aso said at a news conference. ""All policy tools must be used to achieve sustainable growth."" The G20 finance leaders did not issue a communique after their meeting. The widening fallout from the trade conflict between Washington and Beijing forced the IMF this week to slash its forecast for global growth to the slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. While a tentative deal reached by the United States and China last week offered some relief, global policymakers had little to cheer about as the trade spat already has dented business sentiment and hurt export-reliant economies - including those in Asia. In its World Economic Outlook report on Tuesday, the IMF cut its economic growth forecast for the Asia-Pacific region to 5.0% for this year and 5.1% for 2020 - the slowest pace of expansion since the global financial crisis. A faster-than-expected slowdown in China's economic growth could also generate negative spillovers in the region, as many Asian countries have supply chains closely tied to China, the IMF's Rhee said. The IMF slashed China's growth forecast to 6.1% for this year and 5.8% for 2020, pointing to the impact from the trade conflict and tighter regulation to address excess debt.

"BUENOS AIRES, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Top Argentine financeofficials met with a team from the International Monetary Fundon Saturday, the Treasury Ministry said, while tens of thousandsof supporters of President Mauricio Macri gathered just outsidethe presidential palace, waving national flags and cheering. The IMF officials met with Treasury Minister Hernan Lacunza,who was just installed in that position on Tuesday, and centralbank President Guido Sandleris, according to the TreasuryMinistry statement. No details were released on the talks. The IMF team onFriday said it planned to ""exchange views"" over the weekend withthe economic advisers to Argentina's top presidential contendersin the October election, the incumbent Macri and oppositioncandidate Alberto Fernandez. Macri was trounced in the primary election on Aug. 11 byFernandez, who is now the front runner for the Octoberpresidential election. Center-left Peronist Fernandez hascriticized the $57 billion standby agreement Macri struck withthe IMF in 2018, pledging to ""rework"" the deal if elected. Fernandez's landslide support in the primary vote promptedthe peso currency to fall by nearly 18% last week amid fears ofa return to the interventionist economic policies of formerPresident Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who is Fernandez'svice presidential candidate. Macri appeared only briefly on Saturday afternoon, salutingfans in Buenos Aires´ historic Plaza de Mayo, and joining inchants of ""Yes, we can,"" his now-familiar campaign slogan.Supporters launched similar gatherings in large citiesthroughout Argentina. Macri took office in 2015 promising to bring an end to thecyclical crises that over the last 100 years turned one of theworld’s strongest economies into a serial defaulter. But aneconomic recovery has failed to materialize.

"* EU documents show growing concern over shadow banking * Firms like Blackrock, LCH have grown increasingly systemic * EU finance ministers to raise issue at G20, discuss itthis week By Francesco Guarascio BRUSSELS, April 2 (Reuters) - While Brexit and tradedisputes dominate financial headlines, European Union officialsare warning about another risk faced by the bloc and the globaleconomy: the growing importance of new, little-regulatedsystemic financial actors. Changes in global financial rules and investment strategieshave seen the emergence of new giants in global financialmarkets in recent years, among them clearing houses likeLondon-based LCH and asset managers such as Blackrock. EU officials warn the swelling of their books has notcoincided with a proportionate tightening of their oversight,however, meaning the potential risks they pose to financialstability are growing. In three confidential EU documents, seen by Reuters, the EUsends hints at new regulations to reduce those risks. A paper prepared by the Romanian presidency of the EU aheadof an April 5-6 finance ministers meeting invites officials toconsider actions to counter challenges to financial stabilityposed by the asset management industry and clearing houses. Those dangers are further spelled out in a document by theEuropean Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), the body dedicated toprotecting the EU's financial stability which is chaired byEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi. The confidential paper, which will be presented to euro zonefinance ministers at the Bucharest meeting, draws up a list ofrisks to financial stability which include the shadow bankingsystem -- another name for asset managers and investment funds. The threat-list is topped by trade and Brexit dangers, andalso mentions challenges to bank funding and debt sustainabilityrisks. The main reasons for concern over the shadow banking sectorare its increasing size and complexity, the high leverage ofsome funds, lack of risk monitoring and poor transparency. Blackrock, the biggest of all funds, manages some $6trillion of assets, making some giant banks look tiny incomparison. Despite that, it faces lighter requirements and lessstringent oversight than lenders. EU finance ministers will raise this issue at the G20 levelin a meeting with their counterparts in Washington on April11-12, where they will urge partners to address, if necessary,""emerging financial vulnerabilities"" springing from thesector. CLEARING Clearing houses cause similar headaches after their systemicrelevance grew with new regulations that require moretransactions to be centrally cleared, rather than beingconducted bilaterally. After the last financial crisis a decade ago, banks inEurope were forced to contribute to a new rescue fund and raisefresh buffers that would be used in case they fail, under theoversight of a new body, the Single Resolution Board (SRB),created with the task of disposing of failing lenders. But this ""resolution mechanism"" does not cover clearinghouses, like the giant LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange, which dominates clearing of euro-denominatedderivatives worth trillions. With Brexit looming, the EU has changed its rules in a waythat could force LCH to relocate to the bloc after Britainleaves. That is likely to boost the EU's powers of supervisionover systemic clearing houses, but not its ability to limitdamage in the event they go bust. Clearing risks extend to large investment banks, likeJPMorgan and Goldman Sachs which process huge amounts ofsecurities transactions, the SRB's head Elke Koenig said at ahearing in the European Parliament on Tuesday. ""We have not made the progress we should have made on therecovery and resolution"" of clearing houses, Koenig told EUlawmakers, stressing the issue should be primarily addressed atglobal level. These firms have been turned into ""focal points"" of thefinancial system, making them so systemic that their failurewould cause serious trouble, she said, adding that the EU wasbarely prepared for such an event.(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Catherine Evans)","Not just Brexit: EU frets next crisis may come from money managers, clearing","eu documents show growing concern over shadow banking. firms like blackrock , lch have grown increasingly systemic. eu finance ministers to raise issue at g20 , discuss it this week.","exclusive-eu warns of growing risks to financial stability from shadow banks , clearing houses"

With less than five weeks to go before a national election, Time magazine published a picture of him on Wednesday in brownface from an ""Arabian Nights"" party when he was a 29-year-old teacher at a private school in Vancouver. During his apology, he also admitted to performing ""Day O"", a traditional Jamaican song made famous by Harry Belafonte, in brownface during a high school talent show years earlier.

"* CEO, finance chief on roadshow to explain changes * CEO to invest 25% of fixed salary in shares - source * Investors and analysts concerned about revenue(Updates with shareholder on CNBC, background from analystmeeting, share decline) By Rachel Armstrong and Tom Sims LONDON/FRANKFURT, July 9 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bankshares extended losses on Tuesday on investor doubtsthat its chief executive can revive the lender by shrinking theinvestment bank and returning to its roots as banker tocorporate Germany. Christian Sewing, CEO for just over a year, and his financechief are on week-long roadshow to explain the restructuring. Tounderline his commitment, Sewing plans to invest a quarter ofhis fixed salary -- around 820,000 euros -- in Deutsche shares,a person with knowledge of the matter said. Deutsche's stock price has fallen 10 percent since Sunday'srestructuring announcement to cut 18,000 jobs in a 7.4 billioneuro ($8.3 billion) ""reinvention"". It is the biggest two-daydecline in almost three years. By 1312 GMT, shares were down 3.8% on the day, after slidingas much as 6.5% earlier. The bank's bonds also fell. Analysts and investors say Sewing, who joined Deutsche Bankin 1989, is right to cut back its trading desks but question ifhe can make his plan work when interest rates are still low andU.S. banks have expanded their share of the German market. ""There seems to be some concerns around the plan details,particularly the ability for the bank to retain revenues whilecutting costs,"" one of the bank's top 25 shareholders toldReuters, citing worries the bank would need fresh equity toexecute Sewing's plan. Analysts with RBC Capital Markets wrote that the bank'soutlook for revenue growth was ""ambitious"" and there was a highdegree of risk associated with implementing the plan. Ratings agency Fitch, which last month downgraded the bankto ""BBB"" status, the lowest investment-grade, echoed this. ""Cutting back volatile, capital-intensive andunderperforming sales and trading activities, and furtherreducing the cost base should improve profitability andstrengthen leverage, but execution risks are high,"" it said. JOB CUTS Deutsche plans to return closer to its roots by focusing oncorporate banking and asset and wealth management, areas thatcan offer more stable revenues than investment banking but areincreasingly competitive. The bank began cutting jobs in its trading business onMonday, with staff laid off in offices stretching from Sydney toNew York. Sewing, promising to make a break with a past of Deutsche's""over-promising and under-delivering"", told analysts on Mondaythat his plan was a ""real game changer"". At least one big investor is sold on the proposals. Douglas Braunstein, who holds an 3.1% share in Deutschethrough his New York-based Hudson Executive Capital, said itwould take a while for the market to appreciate what DeutscheBank is doing. ""Going back to basics for this 150-year old company isultimately going to be a very successful strategic decision,"" hesaid on CNBC.

"* Huawei to participate in high-speed network build-up -minister * Huawei just one of suppliers tested - Deutsche Telekom unit * Washington has piled pressure on allies to shut out Huawei (Adds response from Magyar Telekom, detail) BUDAPEST, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Hungary's foreign minister opened the way on Tuesday for Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to be involved in the rollout of its high-speed 5G network. The United States has piled pressure on its allies to shut out Huawei Technologies, the leading telecoms equipment vendor with a global market share of 28%, saying its gear contained ""back doors"" that would enable China to spy on other countries. Hungary has said however it had no evidence that Huawei equipment would pose a security threat and Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced at an event in China on Tuesday that Hungary would involve Huawei in the 5G rollout. Szijjarto said Huawei would cooperate with Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom in the Hungarian 5G rollout according to an emailed Foreign Ministry statement. Deutsche Telekom's Hungarian unit said Huawei was just one of the suppliers tested for the 5G technology. Hungary published the draft documentation for the sale of more than 400 megahertz of 5G spectrum in June, aiming for a commercial start of the service at main industrial facilities next year. Magyar Telekom said Hungarian telecoms regulator NMHH had registered it as a participant in the 5G tender. It added however that the regulator had scrapped the previously announced bidding dates and has not published new dates yet. ""Magyar Telekom is currently testing 5G technology with several suppliers, including Huawei's Hungarian unit,"" the company's press office said in an emailed response to questions. ""However, it has not entered into an agreement with Huawei to build up its entire Hungarian 5G network."" Vodafone's Hungarian unit and the Hungarian telecoms regulator could not comment immediately. Hungary had planned to wrap up the 5G tenders by October. At a visit to Budapest in February, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cautioned allies against deploying equipment from the Chinese company, saying it would make it more difficult for Washington to ""partner alongside them"". Hungary's Szijjarto then brushed off U.S. concerns over Russia and China, saying Budapest was fulfilling its obligations to Western allies as a member of the NATO military alliance. The European Union, of which Hungary is a member, has warned of the risk of increased cyber attacks by state-backed entities but refrained from singling out China and Huawei as threats. Hungarian Innovation and Technology Minister Laszlo Palkovics told Reuters in June that Budapest was studying the example of Germany, its biggest foreign investor, where he said an assessment system was developed to precisely identify possible security threats. German regulation had initially not excluded Huawei from the build-out of 5G mobile networks. However, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Monday cast doubt on whether the company could participate in the development and construction of the country's fifth-generation data network.

"* Millenials are the key driver of luxury spend in China * Falling luxury prices in China help boost demand * Brands moving into second, third tier cities By Farah Master and Donny Kwok HONG KONG, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Global luxury brands from Prada to LVMH are investing in China for the first time since a crackdown on conspicuous spending five years ago, focusing on smaller, less developed cities even as the world's second-largest economy slows. Increasing spend by cash-rich Chinese millennials, largely unhindered by a crackdown on corruption and extravagant spending, is prompting brands to revamp some stores and open new ones in second- and third-tier cities where luxury spending is growing faster. The youngsters, who account for around 30 percent of the sector's China sales, are a demographic less sensitive to wider economic factors, executives said. ""There is the emergence in China of a very strong upper class or upper middle class,"" Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and CEO of cosmetics group L'Oreal said on a call with analysts. ""And the difference is that now millennials from this middle and middle upper class are absolutely not hesitant to buy luxury brands."" Often single children armed with family money, the 20-34 year-old demographic started buying luxury brands at a young age and purchases more frequently, splurging on everything from jewellery and fashion, to cosmetics and handbags, industry experts say. Many millennials are also choosing to remain in the country's outlying provinces, shunning more expensive, larger cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, thanks to rapid industrialisation and urbanisation. ""Where the spend is? It is the post-90s, the young generation - definitely a young generation that spends money on luxury,"" said Shanghai-based Daniel Zipser, senior partner at McKinsey & Co. Revenue growth in China's luxury segment was around 15-20 percent for the first half of the year, Zipser added. TRADE WAR JITTERS Chinese luxury shoppers account for over $500 billion yuan ($73 billion) in annual spending, representing almost a third of the global luxury market, McKinsey said in its latest report. Brands including Kering's Gucci to Britain's Burberry and French luxury handbag maker Hermes all reported resilient appetite from Chinese shoppers in the second quarter even as escalating China-U.S. trade tensions cast a pall over the broader economy. The share of luxury purchases made in China is rapidly increasing, several executives said, spurred by price cuts from top brands after authorities reduced import duties on some goods and made it harder to buy products from overseas websites and vendors. A strong euro at the start of 2018 also put off tourists from spending in Europe, executives said. Prices of luxury goods in China, previously significantly higher than in Europe and the United States, have been gradually falling. Taxes have also been lowered by 7-17 percent, allowing firms to cut prices. Italian luxury outerwear maker Moncler has reduced its prices in China by 3.5 percent on average since July, while Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Hermes have also cut prices. ""When I compare it with the United States the price difference between brands is not that large,"" said Sunny Deng, 28, who studies in America but was on holiday in Shanghai. ""Sometimes it's even cheaper here."" SMALLER CITY PUSH To capture the rapidly growing millennial market, global names are increasingly moving further afield from China's first-tier cities - the previous engines of growth. Prada, which reported strong half-year earnings bolstered by Chinese consumers, opened seven stores this year in Xi'an, home of China's Terracotta Army in the northwest. Three were for the Prada label, two for its Miu Miu brand and two for Church's. LVMH opened a store in the sprawling central city of Wuhan, home to 11 million people, while jewellery brand Chaumet opened a store in the city of Wuxi, outside Shanghai. Hermes is launching a store in Xi'an in September. Even so, luxury firms are wary of demand softening in the second half of the year as a trade row between China and the United States escalates. ""It would be unwise not to make some allowances for the uncertain political and macroenvironment,"" Jean-Francois Palus, Kering group managing director, said in July. LVMH chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony, on a call with analysts in July, also warned of potential risks from increased global tariffs. ""Although the luxury industry is not in the front line on this, such a risk would certainly bare some negative consequences for us,"" he said. Brands have also been putting increasing emphasis on their digital offerings to court China's online shoppers. Louis Vuitton and Gucci both launched Chinese e-commerce sites last year and Hermes plans to roll out its site in China later this year. Louis Vuitton has also teamed up with China's Baidu to use facial recognition to support its first fragrance campaign in the country. Zipser said Chinese households were ramping up spending thanks to a younger generation who enjoyed buying luxury. McKinsey expects incremental spend from existing Chinese customers to account for 60 percent of the next 10 years of growth. ""It is all the extra spend per person increasing on that. In the past, it was primarily more people. Now it is more people plus more spend of existing people,"" he said.

" (Philippsburg 2 offline for repairs of a fault)    June 6 (Reuters) - The following table lists planned outages and load reductions at Germannuclear power plants and plants returning online.    Germany has 9,973 megawatts (MW) of nuclear generation capacity provided by seven reactors,operated by three companies.    Previously in 2011, Germany had taken the axe to the bulk of its nuclear capacity, switchingoff the seven oldest blocks plus Vattenfall's Kruemmel permanently after the Japan nuclearcrisis earlier that year raised safety concerns. It also sped up the timetable for closure ofall remaining capacity by 2022. Under that, Philippsburg 2 is to close at end-2019.    Before Fukushima, German nuclear capacity had amounted to around 21,500 MW.    Reactors stop for regular maintenances with fuel element exchanges.

"* PetroChina expects H1 profits to surge * Strong crude prices supported PetroChina's margins * Rival Sinopec also reported best quarter in years BEIJING, July 30 (Reuters) - China's largest oil and gas producer PetroChina expects its profits to more than double in the first half of this year, the latest state oil major to benefit from the revival in crude oil prices. Net profit in the first six months of 2018 will rise by between 13.5 billion yuan ($1.98 billion) to 15.5 billion yuan from the first half of 2017, up by 107 percent to 122 percent from the same period a year ago, PetroChina said in filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Monday. Based on net profit of 12.67 billion yuan in the first half of 2017, PetroChina's net profit is forecast to be 26.17 billion yuan ($3.84 billion) to 28.17 billion yuan in the first six months of 2018. That would be the highest six-month profit for the company since 2015. Based on the company's net profit of 10.15 billion yuan reported in the first quarter, it would also be the best quarterly result since the second quarter of 2015. ""With rising crude prices, the company reported higher sales prices of crude oil, refined products and natural gas,"" PetroChina said. Global oil prices were up almost 20 percent in the first half of 2018 and topped $80 a barrel in May for the first time since 2014. An effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut output, falling Venezuelan output as well as potential drop in Iranian exports has supported crude oil prices.

The benchmark palm oil contract for November delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange was down1.1% at 2,169 ringgit ($520.64) per tonne, heading for a thirdstraight session of losses.    Palm oil may test a support at 2,160 ringgit per tonne, abreak below which could cause a fall to 2,113 ringgit, said WangTao, a Reuters market analyst for commodities and energytechnicals.        ""Palm futures opened lower, mirroring weakness in competingvegetable oils,"" said a Kuala Lumpur-based trader, adding thatthe stronger local currency also weighed on prices.    The ringgit, palm's currency of trade, strengthened to itsstrongest level against the dollar in two weeks and was last up0.2% at 4.1620. A stronger ringgit makes palm oil more expensivefor holders of foreign currencies.     In other related edible oils, U.S. soyoil futures on theChicago Board of Trade fell 0.1%, while the Septembersoyoil contract on the Dalian exchange eased 0.1%.

"By Daniel Wiessner (Reuters) - Supporters of a bill that would strengthen workplace protections for pregnant women told a U.S. House of Representatives' subcommittee on Tuesday that existing law is inadequate and forces many women to choose between endangering their pregnancies or losing their jobs. Current law only prohibits employers from denying pregnant women the same accommodations they already give to workers with disabilities, but many women who sue for pregnancy bias have trouble identifying nonpregnant workers to compare themselves to, Dina Bakst, the copresident of women's rights group A Better Balance, said during a hearing of the House Committee on Education and Labor's Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Human Services. The bill, which was first proposed in 2012, was introduced in May by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat from New York. It has more than 120 cosponsors, including three Republicans. Nadler during the hearing agreed with Bakst that existing protections do not go far enough, saying that ""if you treat your nonpregnant employees terribly, you have every right under the law to treat your pregnant employees terribly."" The bill, called the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), would require employers to provide accommodations such as lifting restrictions, seating or extra bathroom breaks to workers with ""known limitations related to pregnancy,"" and prohibit retaliation against women who request them. It would also mirror the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by requiring that employers engage in an ""interactive process"" with pregnant workers who request accommodations. Ellen McLaughlin, a partner at Seyfarth Shaw in Chicago who represents employers, told the House panel on Tuesday that pregnant workers are already afforded a number of protections under the ADA and the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act, as well as unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, so the proposed bill is unnecessary. And the bill, she said, would create confusion because it fails to define ""known limitations,"" she said. The PWFA, unlike the ADA, also does not include an exception for providing accommodations when a worker would be unable to perform the essential functions of her job, which is an important protection for employers, McLaughlin said. But many businesses welcome a uniform federal standard rather than the existing ""complex matrix"" of state laws, said Iris Wilbur, the vice president of government affairs at Kentucky business group Greater Louisville Inc. At least 27 states have adopted laws requiring companies to accommodate workers' pregnancies. In the 2014 case UPS v. Young, the U.S. Supreme Court said the Pregnancy Discrimination Act requires that employers extend accommodations provided to disabled workers to pregnant women. The decision was hailed as a victory for female workers, but since then about two-thirds of plaintiffs who have sued employers under the PDA have lost their cases, Bakst told lawmakers on Tuesday. The main reason, she said, is because the PDA requires plaintiffs to identify ""similarly situated"" coworkers with disabilities not related to pregnancy, which is difficult and in some cases impossible. Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, said that pregnant women should be granted workplace accommodations, but that the bill was unclear and could do more harm than good by imposing a confusing standard on employers.",House panel vets sweeping pregnancy discrimination bill,supporters of a bill that would strengthen workplace protections for pregnant women told a u.s. house of representatives subcommittee on t tuesday that existing law is inadequate. current law only prohibits employers from denying pregnant women the same accommodations they already give to workers with disabilities. many women who sue for pregnancy bias have trouble identifying nonpregnant workers to compare themselves to.,bill to strengthen pregnancy bias protections for u.s . workers gets mixed reaction from house panel
"By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar got a brief lift on Wednesday when data showed the domestic economy grew far faster than expected last quarter, though sentiment was still stained by a sea of red ink in emerging markets. The Aussie dollar was even having trouble holding at $0.7200, after hitting a 20-month low of $0.7157 overnight, and never came near threatening chart resistance at $0.7236. The fleeting reprieve came as figures showed the Australian economy grew a brisk 0.9 percent in the second quarter, while annual growth raced to its highest in almost six years at 3.4 percent. The result easily topped market forecasts and even outpaced the United States' stellar expansion. ""The surge in GDP growth in the first half of the year meant that the Australian economy notched up 27 years without a recession in style"" said Paul Dales, chief Australia & New Zealand economist at Capital Economics. ""But with house prices falling, credit conditions tightening and the support from the global economy fading, the second half of the year probably won't be quite as good."" Indeed, interest rate futures barely budged on the data with investors still not convinced the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will hike rates until sometime in 2020. Speaking late Tuesday, RBA Governor Philip Lowe emphasised a hike was still some time away and welcomed the recent fall in the Aussie currency as a fillip to growth and inflation. Neither was the global background helpful for the Aussie with strains in emerging markets and a broadly rising U.S. dollar pressuring commodity prices. Shanghai copper futures sank to 14-month lows overnight amid fears the Sino-U.S. trade dispute would ultimately threaten global growth. The same worries were undermining the New Zealand dollar which hit its lowest point since early 2016 at $0.6530, before steadying a little at $0.6547. The next stops were troughs at $0.6419 and $0.6348 from January 2016. A global auction of dairy, the country's single biggest goods export, saw prices fall slightly though a sharp rise in volumes sold suggested demand was picking up. New Zealand government bonds tracked U.S. Treasuries lower following strong U.S. manufacturing data overnight.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong/Shanghai-March 26: Fitch Ratings has assignedChina-based property developer CIFI Holdings (Group) Co. Ltd.'s (BB/Stable)USD255 million 6.55% offshore senior notes due 2024 a final rating of 'BB'.  The notes are rated at the same level as CIFI's senior unsecured rating, as theyrepresent its direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.CIFI intends to use the net proceeds to refinance debt and for working capital.The final rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 21 March 2019. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Sales: CIFI's contracted sales, including contracted sales by JVs andassociated companies, declined by 9% yoy to CNY15.4 billion in January-Februaryin 2019, with the average selling price (ASP) increasing by 15% yoy to CNY16,916per square meter (sq m), mainly due to deliberate slow-down in project launchesin 1H19. CIFI targets to achieve CNY190 billion in total sales, or 25% increaseyoy, with CNY350 billion of saleable resources in 2019. CIFI's total sales roseby 46% to CNY152 billion in 2018 but the ASP fell by 4% to CNY15,900/sq m mainlydue to more contracted sales from third-tier Chinese cities. Higher Leverage: Fitch estimates that CIFI's leverage, measured by netdebt/adjusted inventory with proportionate consolidation of joint ventures (JV)and associates, rose to 45%-50% in 2018 from around 40% in 2017, mainly due tocontinued high land acquisition cash flow in 2018. Fitch expects leverage todrop in the next 12 months as the company plans to slow its land acquisitionpace in 2019 with attributable land acquisitions budgeted at around 55% of salesproceeds, compared with 85% in 2017 and 68% in 2018. Stable Margins: CIFI's EBITDA margin after adding back capitalised interestsfell to 21.6% in 2018 from 26.2% in 2017. The EBITDA margin would have beenhigher at 31.2% in 2018 and 29.1% in 2017 if adjusted for an acquisitionrevaluation, according to the company. CIFI reclassified certain projectcompanies from non-consolidated JVs and associates into subsidiaries and revisedthe fair value of the cost of delivered properties. The accounting changeresulted in a higher cost of goods sold and lower margins.  The acquisition revaluations are likely to continue as CIFI has a significantnumber of JVs and associates, which will make margins appear more volatile.Nevertheless, Fitch believes CIFI's diversified project portfolio across citiesof different tiers allows it to maintain its fast-churn strategy withoutsacrificing the overall project margins.  Geographical Diversification: CIFI had a total land bank of 55 million sq m atend 2018, sufficient for three to four years of development.  CIFI entered 15new cities in 2018, with projects now spread more than 50 cities across China,helping mitigate risks from local policy intervention and economies. CIFIboosted land acquisition in Tier 3 cities in 2018, which were oversupplied, butfocused contracted sales on second-tier and robust third-tier cities, which havemore first-time buyers and upgraders. CIFI's saleable resources remainwell-diversified among cities of different tiers, providing flexibility toadjust the sales mix for various market conditions. DERIVATION SUMMARY CIFI's closest peer is Sino-Ocean Group Holding Limited (BBB-/Stable,standalone: BB+) in terms of contracted sales and land-bank size. Sino-Ocean hascontinued its geographic focus on Tier 1 and affluent Tier 2 cities, while CIFIhas increased its focus on Tier 2 and 3 cities. CIFI's leverage of around 40% issimilar to the leverage Fitch expected for Sino-Ocean in 2018. CIFI's EBITDAmargin, after adjusting for the acquisition revaluation, is higher thanSino-Ocean's 23%-25%, but Fitch expects Sino-Ocean's attributable recurringEBITDA interest coverage from investment properties to be at 0.4x, while CIFI'srecurring income is negligible. The one-notch difference between Sino-Ocean'sstandalone credit profile and CIFI's IDR is based on Sino-Ocean's higherinvestment-property income. CIFI's leverage is significantly lower than that of several 'BB' range peers,including Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. Ltd. (BB-/Negative) and Beijing CapitalDevelopment Holding (Group) Co., Ltd. (BBB-/Negative, standalone: BB). CIFI'sEBITDA margin is in line with that of Guangzhou R&F and Beijing CapitalDevelopment. However, its recurring EBITDA interest coverage is lower thanGuangzhou R&F's 0.2x. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer - Attributable contracted sales of CNY80 billion in 2018, followed by growth of21% in 2019 and 12% in 2020 - Attributable land purchases at around 45%-55% of contracted sales from2018-2020  - Average land acquisition cost of CNY6,000-6,250 per sq m from 2018-2020  - 30% dividend payout ratio RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive RatingAction - Leverage, measured by net debt/adjusted inventory, sustained at below 30.0% - Maintaining high cash flow turnover despite the JV business model andconsolidated contracted sales/debt at over 1.2x (2018: 1.1x) Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative RatingAction - Substantial decrease in contracted sales - EBITDA margin, not adjusting for the effect of acquisition revaluation,sustained at below 25% - Net debt/adjusted inventory sustained above 45% LIQUIDITY Ample Liquidity, Low Funding Cost: CIFI had unrestricted cash of CNY43.3 billionat end-2018, enough to cover short-term debt of CNY13.5 billion. CIFI's averagefunding cost remained stable at 5.8% in 2018 (2017: 5.2%), and should stay lowdue to CIFI's diversified onshore and offshore funding channels, as well as itsactive capital-structure management.

"(Adds details of the protests in Yuen Long and Tsim Sha Tsui) By Alun John and Donny Kwok HONG KONG, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Hong Kong riot police swept into several shopping malls on Saturday, chasing off and arresting some anti-government Hong Kong demonstrators who had gathered to press their demands in the peak shopping weekend before Christmas. In a mall in Yuen Long, close to the China border, hundreds of black-clad protesters marked the five-month anniversary of an attack in a train station by an armed mob wearing white T-shirts which beat up bystanders and protesters with pipes and poles. Police have been criticised for not responding quickly enough to calls for help, and for not arresting any alleged culprits at the scene. They later made several arrests and said the assailants had links to organised criminal gangs, or triads. The protesters demanded justice for the attack, shouting ""Fight for Freedom"" and ""Stand With Hong Kong"". ""The government didn't do anything so far after 5 months ... I deserve an answer, an explanation,"" said a 30-year-old clerk surnamed Law. ""Yuen Long is no longer a safe place ... and we all live in white terror when we worry if we will be beaten up when dressed in black."" As dozens of riot police stormed into the mall to chase protesters off, a sushi restaurant had its window smashed and shops were forced to close. Protests in Hong Kong are now in their seventh month, albeit in a relative lull. Residents are angry at what they see as China's meddling in the city's freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Many are also outraged by perceived police brutality, and are demanding an independent investigation into allegations of excessive force. Other demands include the release of all arrested demonstrators and full democracy. On Friday night, police arrested a man who fired a single shot with a pistol at plain clothes officers in the northern Tai Po district. No one was injured. A search of a nearby flat revealed a cache of weaponry including a semi-automatic rifle and bullets. Steve Li, a senior police officer on the scene, told reporters the police had information that the suspect planned to use the pistol during a protest to ""cause chaos and to hurt police officers."" In Tsim Sha Tsui on Saturday, groups of protesters also converged on a mall popular with mainland Chinese luxury shoppers. ""We can't celebrate Christmas when our city is taken over by the police. When you see the police outside the mall, do you feel like shopping for presents?"" said Bob, 17, a protester.

"By Melissa Fares Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S. holiday spending in 2018 grew alower-than-expected 2.9 percent to $707.5 billion, the NationalRetail Federation said on Thursday, citing turmoil over tradepolicy and the recent government shutdown as having hurt theindustry. ""All signs during the holidays seemed to show that consumersremained confident about the economy,"" NRF President and ChiefExecutive Matthew Shay said in a statement. ""However, it appears that worries over the trade war andturmoil in the stock markets impacted consumer behavior morethan we expected,"" he said. NRF's numbers are based on data from the U.S. CommerceDepartment, which said on Thursday that overall December sales –including auto dealers, gas stations and restaurants – were down1.2 percent seasonally adjusted from November but up 2.3 percentunadjusted year-over-year. The retail group said sales in November grew 5.1 percent butin December were up only 0.9 percent year-over-year and weredown 1.5 percent seasonally adjusted from November. NRF does notcount October as part of the holiday season. The numbers fell short of NRF's forecast last fall thatholiday sales from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31 would grow between 4.3percent and 4.8 percent, to between $717.45 billion and $720.89billion. The holiday retail sales numbers exclude automobiles,gasoline stations and restaurants, NRF said. The trade body also said online and other non-store sales,which are included in the overall number, grew 11.5 percent to$146.8 billion. NRF had forecast the online sector of retailwould grow between 11 percent and 15 percent, to between $151.6billion and $157 billion. ""Today's numbers are truly a surprise and in contradictionto the consumer spending trends we were seeing, especially aftersuch strong October and November spending,"" NRF Chief EconomistJack Kleinhenz said. ""The combination of financial market volatility, thegovernment shutdown and trade tensions created a trifecta ofanxiety and uncertainty impacting spending and might also havemisaligned the seasonal adjustment factors used in reportingdata,"" he said. Earlier this month the trade body said it expected U.S.retail sales to rise between 3.8 percent and 4.4 percent to morethan $3.8 trillion in 2019, encouraged by higher consumerconfidence, low unemployment and rising wages. It also said it expects the overall economy to gain anaverage of 170,000 jobs per month in 2019, down from 220,000 in2018.

"By John McCrank NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - Imperative Execution, astartup electronic stock trading venue operator, has found earlysuccess using artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce pricemovements after trades, and now it plans to use the technologyto help brokers get larger trades done. Imperative Execution runs IntelligentCross, a tradingplatform known as an alternative trading system (ATS) that waslaunched in September and in the six months since has matchedmore than 1 billion shares. (Chart https://tmsnrt.rs/2IpCmeQ) To be sure, the company faces tough competition against 31other ATSs and 13 stock exchanges like Nasdaq Inc andIntercontinental Exchange Inc's New York Stock Exchange,which together have matched around 6.5 billion shares each daythis month. What sets IntelligentCross apart is that AI is a key featureof the ATS. Founder and Chief Executive Roman Ginis said hisfirm uses AI to measure the outcomes of trades in real time andthen adjusts trading schedules to help brokers get betterexecutions and save their clients money. ""We want to build venues that solve for particular tradingoutcomes,"" Ginis, a former trader at Cubist SystematicStrategies, the computer-driven trading arm of Steven Cohen'shedge fund Point72, said in an interview. The ATS currently uses an AI-assisted order type thatrandomly matches undisplayed orders at the midpoint of themarket's best bid and offer every few milliseconds, rather thanwhen the orders arrive. It then measures how much specific stock prices move andshifts the intervals between matching times to minimize pricemovements after the following trades. The company says this can reduce the costs between thearrival price of an order and the execution price for completinga trade by more than one basis point, which for the entire U.S.stock market would add up to around $10 billion per year. Jack Miller, head of trading at brokerage Baird, said hisfirm has had success finding buyers and sellers onIntelligentCross with a very low level of market impact. ""Innovations like this are important to us in driving bestexecution for our clients,"" he said. In May, IntelligentCross is launching a new order typecalled the Adverse Selection Protection Engine, or ASPEN.Adverse selection refers to trading against market participantswho have more information than you, potentially leaving you onthe wrong side of the trade, making larger trade sizes risky. Aspen's AI will queue up displayed orders and match them 150microseconds to 300 microseconds apart, depending on the ordersize. Not matching them immediately gives brokers time to adjusttheir order sizes or cancel them, depending on what the marketis doing in the interim. ""It is designed to allow you the time to make a decision –not a ton of time, but enough with modern technology - then youdon't need to react to every single flutter of quotes on theStreet,"" said Ginis. If a broker posting a quote is not afraid of getting pickedoff, it will post larger quote sizes for others to tradeagainst, he said.

"(John Lloyd co-founded the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford, where he is senior research fellow. The opinions expressed here are his own.) By John Lloyd Oct 5 (Reuters) - Few great social changes are wholly positive. “Safe spaces,” for example. Most popular in universities, they’re meant to provide a feeling of security for those who feel vulnerable, a place where students can avoid issues that might cause them distress. The downside of the safe space initiative is its weaponization, its use to exclude so that criticism, opposing opinions and alternative analyses are not confronted and argued over, but prohibited. Jim Sidanius, a professor of psychology and African American Studies at Harvard, is among those – like the writers of recent books such as William Egginton’s “The Splintering of the American Mind” and Greg Lukianoff and Jonathon Haidt’s “The Coddling of the American Mind” – who find it concerning. Sidanius did a study of safe spaces constructed by students of different ethnic backgrounds – and says that for minority who joined these groups, “the more likely (they) were to feel that they were in this zero-sum relationship with other ethnic groups on campus.” The safer within the group the more hostile to those outside. Others protest that they’re needed. RaeAnn Pickett wrote in Time magazine in August 2016 that she sought such spaces while suffering from postpartum depression. Finding one, she writes that when received by a “safe space,” “I felt the weight slowly start to lift from my chest. All the pent-up anxiety I had felt was dissipating.” Pickett argues that a commitment to free speech is less important than the question – “whose speech is being protected by these policies?” That question has taken on a new relevance beyond university campuses. Now it should be asked whether the most famed liberal magazines are seeking a “safe space” for themselves, one in which they don’t confront people whom they, or their readers, deem to be intolerable. Last month, the weaponizing of the spirit behind safe spaces struck down one distinguished editor and struck another, temporarily, dumb. The first was Ian Buruma, the New York Review of Books editor and a writer who for over four decades has collected awards for his writing and tributes to his liberalism. Buruma left his post after a furor over his decision to publish an essay by Jian Ghomeshi, fired from his job as presenter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2014 after accusations of sexually assaulting more than 20 women. A first trial found him not guilty; a second was stopped because he signed a “peace bond” and publicly apologized. Buruma said he wanted to print Ghomeshi’s story to explore what it was like to be a high-profile public figure caught in serious allegations – then acquitted of most of the criminal charges. What, Buruma wanted to know, happens “when people are not found to have broken the law but have misbehaved in other ways nonetheless. How do you deal with such cases? Should that last forever?” When one of the women affected complained, he offered to print her objections at length. For printing that article, Buruma roused the ire of many on his editorial staff, while his publisher pointed out that many of the academic publishers which are the Review’s main advertising source said they would refuse to advertise. Buruma, apparently feeling he had no choice, resigned. The other editor was David Remnick of the New Yorker, the city’s superlative magazine of longform journalism. Remnick, too, is garlanded with awards, including a Pulitzer. He has greatly raised the profile of the weekly magazine, and is a star of its annual Festival, where he interviews prominent cultural and political figures. He thought it would be good, this year, to do an interview with Steve Bannon – the former adviser to President Donald Trump, cast out of the White House and now a roving ambassador for right-wing nationalism through his movement – called, “The Movement” – mainly in Europe. The New Yorker editor didn’t invite him for a friendly chat; he announced that “I have every intention of asking him difficult questions and engaging in a serious and even combative conversation.” Invited – then disinvited. A cry of protest made Remnick quickly change his mind, and cancel the Bannon interview. He mooted the vague possibility of a later, less public confrontation, prompting Bannon to call him “gutless.” Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the editor of The Economist, Zanny Minton Beddoes, confirmed the former presidential adviser’s invitation to her newspaper’s “Open Future” Festival. These are much more than low points in high literary society. They are affronts to the trade of journalism. From the writings of John Milton, John Stuart Mill, the American Federalists and the U.S. Constitution itself, the assumption has been that freedom to speak and to publish included the freedom to offend. To offend – and to know the nature of those who offend you. To read Adolf Hitler’s memoir, Mein Kampf, for example, is to go beyond the cardboard villain into the intellectual and emotional alleyways in which the Nazi leader found justification for what became the Holocaust. To understand, even in part, a monster through his own words is a sounder basis for opposition to fascism than mere sloganeering. Buruma and Remnick operated at a much milder level than helping to air the views of the founder of the Nazi party. But several American journalists interviewed Hitler – including Dorothy Thomson, for the first time in 1931. She described him as “inconsequent and voluble, ill poised and insecure…the very prototype of the little man.” The interview (though not her dismissive impression of the man) was uncontroversial. It was what journalists did. She was later expelled from Germany. Journalism includes interviewing, or hearing from, monsters, and those with whom we simply find fundamentally wrong, so that we can judge them for ourselves. It roots agency in the reader and viewer. There is no “safe space” for a mind which wishes to understand something of the world. A liberal society cannot create boundaries to understanding between the approved and the forbidden. The pressures which prompted Buruma’s dismissal and Bannon’s disinvitation are – no matter what their intention - illiberal, in the long run more dangerous to society than the censorship they promote.

"By Manas Mishra (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday it would reorganize into three units, separating its consumer healthcare business that the U.S. drugmaker has been trying to sell since last year. The news comes a day after the company decided to defer drug price increases for no more than six months, following criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump for raising list prices of some medicines. The units would be Innovative Medicines, Established Medicines and Consumer Healthcare. The company is currently split into two units - Innovative Medicines, which includes the consumer business, and Essential Health. ""This design gives us a sharper focus on diverse patients in diverse markets,"" Albert Bourla, chief operating officer said. The Innovative Medicines business will now also include biosimilars and a new hospital business unit, and together with the Consumer Healthcare business, will account for about three-quarters of the company's revenue. Pfizer's 2017 annual revenue was $52.55 billion. Pfizer said it would still evaluate options for its consumer healthcare business and expects to make a decision in 2018. The company said in October last year that it was considering the sale or spin-off of the consumer healthcare business, which is worth about $15 billion. In May, Pfizer said that it had not received an acceptable offer. The business consists of products ranging from Advil to lip balms. The Established Medicines unit would include the majority of the company's off-patent brands, including Viagra and neurological disease treatment Lyrica as well as some generic drugs.

"    By Mark Miller     CHICAGO (Reuters) - The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.     The U.S. Internal Revenue Service hoisted a big red-flag warning to retirees earlier this month: take a look at how much income tax you are paying throughout 2018, because the amount could need an adjustment in the wake of the new federal tax law.     The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), signed into law by President Donald Trump last December, made important changes to tax rates, brackets, deductions and exemptions that affect all taxpayers. Retirees need to pay special attention to income coming from tax-deferred retirement accounts, pensions and annuities. Higher-income retirees may also owe taxes on Social Security benefits.      The amount of total income tax you owe could be going up or down, depending on your personal circumstances.      Failing to pay the right amount through the year could subject you to a penalty next April when your federal income tax return is filed. The penalty is determined by multiplying an interest rate, determined by the IRS, by your underpaid amount; the current interest rate is 5 percent. Taxation of retirement income by states is all over the map (https://bit.ly/2MPajDB), but your state tax return also could be impacted.     The IRS issued a bulletin earlier this month urging retirees to do a check-up on amounts that are being paid in quarterly installments or withheld (https://bit.ly/2oWUbX4). Taxes are due throughout the year, either through quarterly estimated payments, or through withholding by pension plan sponsors or annuity providers. Taxes also are owed on Social Security.     The TCJA marks the first major revision of the tax code since 1986. It reduced tax rates and expanded income tax brackets. The standard deduction nearly doubled from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly, and from $6,350 to $12,000 for single filers. But the standard deduction actually is higher for most retirees, because taxpayers older than 65 can deduct an additional $1,300. In addition, the TCJA caps deductions for state and local income and property taxes at $10,000 for both married couples and single individuals, and personal exemptions were eliminated.     You may need to increase or reduce the amount of tax being paid during the year - and there is still time to make an adjustment before the year ends. “There are enough moving parts here that the only way to get the right answer is to run a projection,” said Greg Rosica, partner in EY's private client services practice in New York City.              HOW TO AVOID A PENALTY     One way to avoid a penalty, Rosica notes, is to base your payments on the prior-year taxes and pay “at least 100 or 110 percent of that amount.” Another way is to project the amount you owe for the current year and pay at least 90 percent in four quarterly installments. (The final quarterly payment for 2018 is due on Jan. 15, 2019.)     The third method is annualized income installment. This is used by taxpayers who receive uneven levels of income throughout the year; this approach smoothes the amount owed quarterly using a reasonable estimate of your income for the year. For more on this, see Chapter Two of IRS Publication 505. (https://bit.ly/2xsEWsU)  For retirees who receive a monthly pension or annuity check, this may mean changing the amount of federal income tax they have withheld.      If you are underpaying on income that requires quarterly payments, send in the unpaid amount as soon as possible to stop underpayment penalties from accruing. If additional payments are due on income that is withheld, contact your former employer to make a change. The IRS cautions that due to the limited amount of time remaining this year, you might need to cover this type of expected tax liability through an additional direct tax payment, as you would a quarterly payment.     Higher-income retirees also pay taxes on Social Security benefits. The TCJA does not change the formulas for taxation of benefits, but Social Security income does figure in to your total income tax liability as determined by the federal tax rates.     Social Security beneficiaries receive a form from the IRS during tax season (Form SSA-1099) that reports net benefit subject to tax after Part B Medicare premiums have been subtracted. No taxes are paid by beneficiaries with combined income equal to or below $25,000 for single filers and $32,000 for married filers; above those levels, tax is determined according to two income tiers. (https://bit.ly/2PUcyHL)     The IRS notes it is possible to ask the Social Security Administration to withhold tax on benefits at one of four flat rates as part of an overall withholding plan; you can initiate withholding by filing IRS Form W-4v.     Unsure of whether your withholding or quarterly payments should be adjusted? Rosica advises consulting an accountant, or using an online tool to analyze your situation. The IRS website offers a withholding calculator that offers a good start (https://bit.ly/2aLxK0A).  You will want to have last year’s tax return handy, and records of how much you have withheld or paid so far this year.

"By Karen Pierog May 3 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's longstanding pledge to payoff about $13 billion of outstanding general obligation (GO)bonds is just an unsecured promise, according to the latestlawsuits brought by the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth's federallycreated financial oversight board. Its action capped off a barrage of litigation this week thatunsettled the $3.8 trillion U.S. municipal market, where states,cities, schools and other issuers sell debt. Complaints were filed in U.S. District Court in Puerto Ricolate on Thursday against GO bondholders, including mutual fundsand other institutional and individual investors who contendthey have a lien on the island government's revenue. The board countered that Puerto Rico's pledge of its ""goodfaith, credit and taxing power"" is ""nothing more than a promiseto pay"" and that promise is not secured by any of thegovernment's property. Even if a lien existed under local law,it would be avoidable under bankruptcy law, according to thelawsuits. Defendants included BlackRock Financial Management, whoserepresentative declined to comment. The lawsuits were filed ahead of the second anniversary ofPuerto Rico's May 3, 2017, bankruptcy, which seeks torestructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. They followed other litigation this week against hundreds ofgovernment vendors, as well as Wall street banks and firms thatparticipated in the island's bond sales. The board also wentafter certain GO bondholders in an attempt to recoup past debtservice payments. James Spiotto, managing director of Chapman StrategicAdvisors and a municipal bankruptcy expert, called the board'sattack against liens a probable negotiating ploy. ""Clearly, there's not a lot alleged as far as facts inthere,"" he said on Friday. While detailing ""significant risks"" for investors, theprospectus for $3.5 billion of GO bonds Puerto Rico sold in 2014pointed to the commonwealth's ""irrevocable pledge"" of its creditand taxing power to pay off the debt. It also stated that thebonds have a ""first claim on available commonwealth resources""under Puerto Rico's constitution. In January, the oversight board filed a motion seeking toinvalidate more than $6 billion of GO bonds - the 2014 issue andbonds sold in 2012 - on the basis they were issued in violationof constitutional debt limits. Analysts said the litigation involving GO bonds could harmthe municipal market and make it harder for the board to meetits mandate under the 2016 federal PROMESA Act to restore PuertoRico's capital markets access. ""It will cast a dark cloud over any other full-faith generalobligation credit in the future if they get away with it,"" saidRichard Ciccarone, the head of Merritt Research Services.

"By Maria Caspani NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City acupuncturist and herbalist Clayton Shiu says  demand for traditional Chinese remedies has surged at his practice since March 1, the day New York announced its first case of the novel coronavirus. ""It was like a light switch was flipped,"" said Shiu, who had stocked up and had an ample supply of herbs on hand for his patients. Kamwo Meridian Herbs, a shop in the heart of New York's Chinatown and a longtime supplier to practitioners like Shiu, has experienced a similar jump in demand for traditional Chinese remedies for respiratory and other ailments. To counter the outbreak in China, which has reported nearly 81,000 cases, the government initiated a series of emergency research programs that include traditional Chinese medicines, which are widely used in the world's most populous nation. Last year, the World Health Organization formally recognized traditional medical therapies such as acupuncture and herbal supplementation medicine, conferring more mainstream recognition of the practices, which date back more than 2,500 years. At Kamwo, prescription orders for herb formulas used to treat flu-like symptoms and boost the immune system almost doubled since late February as confirmed cases of coronavirus started spreading across the United States. On a recent afternoon, the store was bustling with activity as the delicate scent of medicinal herbs wafted through the air. Against the backdrop of an imposing apothecary cabinet, workers loaded herbs onto old-fashioned weighing scales as customers placed orders for formulas that include honeysuckle, cinnamon twig, peony root and other substances. Since the outbreak began, members of the close-knit traditional Chinese medicine community have been sharing formulas for prevention and treatment, helping boost demand for certain ingredients and driving up prices, Shiu said. Patients infected by the coronavirus, which has already contributed to at least 22 deaths in the United States as of Monday and nearly 4,000 worldwide, often present symptoms such as fever and cough, similar to those found in influenza patients. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19. SUPPLY WOES At Calihouse Nutrition, a tiny shop in the heart of New York's Chinatown, Patrick Siu was dealing with a steady stream of customers who were inspecting shelves and barrels filled with herbs and roots.

Best-selling items such Japanese honeysuckle and the popular cold remedy Ban Lan Gen Chong Ji were already hard to find and prices were rising fast, according to Siu, 48, who emigrated to the United States from Hong Kong in the late 1980s. With demand so high, herb purveyors and practitioners have become concerned about a growing supply crunch for certain herbs that come almost exclusively from China. Mayway, a Chinese medicine business in San Francisco, said on its website that it had experienced an ""unusual increase in ordering quantities"" and asked its customers to limit their orders to what was needed. It said it anticipated supply delays ""due to the low volume of container ships currently leaving China,"" according to its website. ""Vendors have told us you can't order more than 50% of what you normally do, (you) have to ration for flu herbs,"" said Thomas Leung, chief executive of Kamwo.

"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote http://tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Sterling fell on Tuesday after a second poll showed the Conservative Party's lead is narrowing before the British election next month. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have led the opposition Labour Party, and hopes that a Johnson victory would end more than three years of uncertainty over Brexit have lifted the pound, despite concern about a no-deal exit from the European Union. But according to a survey by Kantar published on Tuesday, Labour has squeezed the Conservatives lead to 11 points from 18 over the past week. The poll is the second in two days to show a narrowing of the ruling party's lead. On Monday, an ICM poll for Reuters gave the Conservatives a seven-point lead, down from 10 points a week earlier. Sterling slipped 0.2 percent to $1.2876 in early European trading on Tuesday, after rising as high as $1.2913 on Monday. Against the euro, the pound was down 0.2 percent at 85.555 pence, off Monday's one-week high of 85.30. Most analysts say the pound is gaining on signs the Conservative Party is headed for victory on Dec. 12, despite this week's polling data. ""The pound has strengthened as a reassuring Tory majority would mean that the risk of hard Brexit is small while avoiding political lock-ups in Parliament and getting a growth-oriented economic policy,"" Lauri Hälikkä, fixed income and FX strategist at SEB, said in a note sent to clients. ""A Labour victory would certainly give a softer Brexit but also very radical socialist policies, which few believe would be good for the pound."" Expectations for a Conservative win, alongside a decline in the threat of a no-deal Brexit, have pushed sterling up almost 8% since early September.

"(Adds MTN share price fall) By Alexis Akwagyiram and Didi Akinyelure LAGOS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Nigeria's central bank governor is to meet representatives of telecommunications company MTN and banks on Tuesday to discuss a dispute over the repatriation of $8.1 billion, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The dispute is over the transfer of $8.1 billion of funds which Nigeria's central bank said the company had sent abroad in breach of foreign-exchange regulations. Nigeria, which accounts for a third of the South African company's annual core profit, is MTN's biggest market. The people with knowledge of the matter, who did not want to be named, said executives from MTN and the four lenders involved in the case - Standard Chartered, Stanbic IBTC Bank , Citibank and Diamond Bank - would hold talks with Nigerian Central Bank Governor Godwin Emefiele on Tuesday. MTN declined to comment and a central bank spokesman did not respond to a text message and phone calls seeking comment. Shares in MTN, Africa's biggest telecoms company, weakened more than 4 percent on Tuesday on uncertainty over the outcome of a meeting and by 1127 GMT were down 2.21 percent at 84.10 rand. The stock has lost around 20 percent since the demand by Nigeria's central bank on Aug. 29. Nigeria's central bank said the funds had been illegally moved abroad because the company's bankers had failed to verify MTN had met all the foreign exchange regulations. MTN has denied the allegations. The talks in Nigeria come days after Emefiele said the bank may reduce the amount to be repatriated. The money is more than half of MTN's market capitalisation, and analysts have said the demand risked further undermining Nigeria's efforts to shake off an image as a risky frontier market for international investors. The banks involved have previously said they would engage with the country's financial regulator.

"(Updates with judge's ruling in Ohio) By Ellen Wulfhorst NEW YORK, March 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Closing U.S. abortion clinics as non-essential is a political  effort to exploit the pandemic to limit reproductive rights, supporters said on Monday after filing legal action against states that ordered clinics to shut down. Several Midwestern and Southern states that already have strict abortion laws have included the clinics in their lists of elective facilities to be closed to preserve resources and protective equipment to fight the spread of the coronavirus. Clinics in Ohio, Iowa, Alabama and Oklahoma responded with litigation accusing officials of using the orders on non-essential procedures to limit abortion access. ""Banning abortion doesn't slow the transmission of the virus, it just forces people to stay pregnant - and have children - against their will,"" said Jennifer Dalven, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, a leading rights group representing abortion providers. In Ohio, the lawyers argued before a federal court judge that closing clinics would violate the right to abortion guaranteed by the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973. The judge issued a temporary restraining order allowing the clinics to remain open for now. Noting that the closings were taking place in states with strict laws limiting abortion access, Nancy Northup, head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, called them ""sham justifications to shut down clinics and make an end run around Roe v. Wade."" ""These same states have tried to ban abortion access for years - no one should be fooled that this is warranted by the current crisis,"" she said. But abortion opponents welcomed the closing of clinics. ""Abortion clinics conducting business as usual in the presence of a life-threatening disease show just how callous pro-abortion groups and abortionists are to protecting life at any stage,"" Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life, said in a recent statement. Clinics also sued last week in the state of Texas, where officials said abortions were medically unnecessary except for those needed to save the mother's life or health. On Monday, a judge in Texas also issued a temporary restraining order to allow clinics there to remain. Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the nation's coronavirus task force, urged Americans on March 18 to put off elective surgery to allow hospitals to concentrate on the rising influx of patients with COVID-19. Abortion remains one of the most divisive issues in U.S. society, with the Supreme Court due to rule in June on a major case which challenges a Louisiana law that could make it harder for women to obtain the procedure. Abortions in the United States are usually performed in outpatient settings or at home using drugs to end pregnancies, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group.

"By Bérengère Sim and Daina Beth Solomon MEXICO CITY, July 4 (Reuters) - Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's party could face a $10 million fine for violations of campaign finance rules, the national electoral institute said on Wednesday following the group's wide-reaching election victory. Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor who has vowed to root out corruption and make government contracts transparent, on Sunday won by a landslide while his leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) took an outright majority in Congress. The possible fine of more than 197 million pesos, slated to be put to a vote by the National Electoral Institute (INE) on July 18, would be the largest related to campaign financing for the recently concluded election season. It is nearly as much as the 207.5 million pesos authorized by INE as MORENA's public financing for campaign spending in 2018 federal elections. MORENA's representative at the institute did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to INE, MORENA formed a trust that it did not report in which it deposited, mostly through cash deposits, about $4 million (78.8 million pesos) as well as checks and bank transfers. ""The party actively participated in forming this financial instrument to collect resources as a financing method contrary to the rules,"" INE said in a statement on Wednesday. It said the estimate of a possible fine was based on omissions in MORENA's fiscal report as well as exceeding cash contribution limits and receiving funds from unknown persons and prohibited entities. Two sources with knowledge of the matter said the trust under investigation was called ""For the Others,"" set up by MORENA to help victims of last September's devastating earthquakes. INE said about $3 million (64.4 million pesos) was withdrawn from the trust, distributed in checks to party members and were cashed later. The INE began its investigation after the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party filed a complaint claiming MORENA had launched the fund without reporting it to authorities.

"By Sebastien Malo NEW YORK, July 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The death toll from heatwaves could rise by up to 2,000 percent in some parts of the world by 2080, according to a study released on Tuesday, as large parts of the northern hemisphere reeled from unusually high temperatures. Scientists have long warned that climate change will bring more extreme weather across the globe, from heatwaves to hurricanes. The researchers behind the latest study say it is the largest yet on the death toll of heatwaves, which they predict will increase in frequency and severity. ""Future heatwaves in particular will be more frequent, more intense and will last much longer,"" said Yuming Guo, associate professor at Australia's Monash University, in a statement. ""If we cannot find a way to mitigate the climate change (reduce the heatwave days) and help people adapt to heatwaves, there will be a big increase of heatwave-related deaths in the future."" Heat waves sweeping through the northern hemisphere have dominated the news in recent weeks, with dozens of deaths registered from Japan to Canada. The study, published in the online journal PLOS Medicine, looked at 20 countries on four continents and found the rise in mortality was likely to be highest near the equator. Hardest-hit Colombia could suffer 2,000 percent more premature deaths from extreme heat during the period of 2031 to 2080 compared with 1971 to 2010, it said. The Philippines and Brazil were also likely to see large increases in numbers of premature deaths, it found. Countries located further from the equator such as the United States and European nations would see smaller hikes. However even under best-case scenarios - where planet-warming emissions were curbed and population increases low - deaths would increase, the study found. During heatwaves, defined as at least two consecutive days of abnormally hot temperatures, the body cannot dissipate heat, leaving older adults in particular at risk of suffering from medical conditions such as heat stroke. Relying on historical data, the researchers used climate models to estimate future temperatures. They said their conclusions highlighted the need to take measures now to avert a future public health crisis. Measures to mitigate the effects of hot weather can include opening cooling centers and painting rooftops white to reflect light and keep homes cool.

"* Police raid broadcaster's office, newspaper editor's home * Raids carried out after reports on Afghanistan,surveillance * Police say raids unrelated, concern classified material(Adds identity and comments from alleged whistleblower) By Byron Kaye SYDNEY, June 5 (Reuters) - Australian police raided theoffices of the national broadcaster on Wednesday overallegations it had published classified material, the secondraid on a media outlet in two days, prompting complaints ofassaults on press freedom. The Australian Federal Police said its officers carried outa search warrant at the head office of the government-fundedAustralian Broadcasting Corp. (ABC) in Sydney. Police raided the home of a News Corp editor a dayearlier, although they said the raids were unrelated. The ABC said the raid was over its 2017 reports aboutalleged misconduct by Australian troops in Afghanistan, whileNews Corp said the raid at an editor's home on Tuesday relatedto a 2018 report about plans for surveillance of Australians'emails, text messages and bank records. ""It is highly unusual for the national broadcaster to beraided in this way,"" ABC Managing Director David Anderson saidin a statement. ""This is a serious development and raises legitimateconcerns over freedom of the press and proper public scrutiny ofnational security and defence matters,"" he said. News Corp, controlled by media baron Rupert Murdoch, calledthe raid ""outrageous and heavy handed"", and ""a dangerous act ofintimidation"". Police questioning of journalists is not new, but raids ontwo influential news organisations sparked warnings thatnational security was being used to justify curbs onwhistleblowing and reporting that might embarrass thegovernment. ""There are insufficient safeguards to prevent lawenforcement agencies from using these powers to exposejournalists' confidential sources,"" said Emily Howie, a LegalDirector at the Human Rights Law Centre. ""This is shocking for those who are targeted but thissurveillance also has a chilling effect on people comingforward,"" she added. The ABC investigations editor, John Lyons, tweeted a photoof the search warrant which showed the targets included two ABCjournalists, the organisation's news director and a formerAustralian military lawyer, David William McBride, who wascharged last year with leaking national secrets. Media reportssaid he had pleaded not guilty. ""It's a complex case but it's also a simple case. It comesdown to: At what point are you obliged to basically rebelagainst the government?"" online publication The New Daily quotedMcBride as saying on Wednesday. Reuters was not immediately able to reach McBride to verifyhis comments. 'DANGEROUS DAY' The raids came barely two weeks after Australia'sconservative government won a May 18 election it was widelyexpected to lose, and which almost cost Home Affairs MinisterPeter Dutton his seat. The home affairs minister must authorise raids consideredpolitically sensitive, according to guidelines on the policewebsite. Dutton denied involvement in the police investigations andsaid his office was notified after the raids were carried out. ""It is entirely appropriate they conduct theirinvestigations independently and, in fact, it is their statutoryobligation,"" Dutton said in a statement. Police confirmed they had not notified Dutton in advance andsaid their actions were ""independent and impartial at alltimes"". Both raids ""relate to separate allegations of publishingclassified material ... which is an extremely serious matterthat has the potential to undermine Australia's nationalsecurity"", they added. ABC staff posted footage and comments as the raid unfolded. ""This is a bad, sad and dangerous day for a country where wehave for so long valued ... a free press,"" Lyons said onTwitter. Peter Greste, director of the Alliance for Journalists'Freedom, said the raids were a serious issue for Australians whohe said cared deeply about press freedom. Greste is a former Al Jazeera reporter who was jailed withtwo colleagues in Egypt from 2013-2015 on national securitycharges brought by the Egyptian government. ""I'm not suggesting that Australia is about to become Egyptany time soon but what we are seeing seems to me to be on thesame spectrum,"" he said.

"By Carolyn Crist (Reuters Health) - On weekday mornings, two healthy activities - exercise and sleep - compete with each other for time, researchers say. As exercise increases, sleep decreases among those who wake up early to work out before heading to their jobs, the study authors report in the journal Sleep Health. At the same time, getting some exercise versus none during the day also helped people to sleep better. ""Sleep research has focused on the ways that sleep deprivation affects overall health, but at some point we began wondering what people were doing with the time they weren't sleeping,"" said senior study author Dr. Mathias Basner of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society both recommend seven or more hours of sleep per night, yet more than a third of adults in the U.S. say they sleep less than that. ""We all have 24 hours in a day, so for the people who only sleep five or six hours, are they doing a healthy behavior or sitting in front of the TV eating chips?"" Basner said in a phone interview. ""We've been trying to identify activities that could be traded for more sleep."" Basner and colleagues analyzed American Time Use Survey data for nearly 48,000 working men and women interviewed on a weekday between 2003 and 2016. As part of the survey, participants logged how they spent their time in the previous 24 hours. Researchers found that people spent most of their time working and commuting. About 17 percent said they had exercised in the last 24 hours. Overall, long work hours were associated with both short sleep and low exercise rates. At the same time, those who exercised slept an average of 15 minutes less than those who didn't. In fact, sleep time dropped as exercise time increased. The strongest association between exercise and sleep was seen among people who exercised between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. or between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. Exercise for up to an hour either in the morning or the evening was not associated with significantly shorter sleep. ""The problem is, we can't tell people to work less, but we can look at habits before bed, which is usually TV watching, or in the morning, which is commuting and grooming,"" Basner said. ""This study suggests it's possible to both exercise and get enough sleep."" Basner and colleagues were surprised to find that in contrast to previous advice about not exercising before bed, those who got physical activity later at night seemed to still get plenty of sleep. Instead of harming sleep, exercising during the day, even if close to bedtime, might help people to sleep more deeply or fall asleep sooner, he said. ""This probably depends on personality, too, and whether someone has an early or late circadian preference,"" he added. ""An owl who is likely to go to bed at 1 a.m. might exercise well at night, and the lark who wakes up at 5 a.m. anyway might exercise before work."" Family income and education levels influenced sleep time as well. Generally, those who earn more and have higher education tend to get less sleep, but they're also more likely to exercise. Although this study was based in the U.S., Basner speculates the same would apply in other developed countries. ""There is the impression that we are pressed for time now more than ever. This is probably due, in part, to exposure to more time-wasting things like social media, nevertheless, clearly for many people there is a perceived choice between healthy behaviors,"" said Shawn Youngstedt, a researcher at Arizona State University in Tempe who wasn't involved in the study. A limitation of using American Time Use Survey data to study exercise and sleep, he said, is that ""sleep"" includes lying in bed and resting, which could skew the results. At the same time, he said by email, ""This advances an excellent idea to try to promote exercise at times in which it does not curtail sleep. Offering exercise opportunities at work would probably facilitate healthy and more productive workers.""

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): Huitong 2018-3 Retail Auto Mortgage Loan Securitization Trust https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10051762 Huitong 2018-3 Retail Auto Mortgage Loan Securitization Trust - Appendix https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10051803 Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong-December 11: Fitch Ratings has assigned expected ratings to Huitong 2018-3 Retail Auto Mortgage Loan Securitization Trust's fixed-rate notes. The issuance consists of notes backed by Chinese automotive loan receivables originated by GAC-Sofinco Automobile Finance Co., Ltd., a joint venture between Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. and CA Consumer Finance (A+/Stable/F1). The ratings are as follows: CNY3,320 million Class A notes: 'AA+(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable; CNY340 million Class B notes: 'AA+(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable; and CNY340 million subordinated notes: 'NR(EXP)sf'. The notes will be issued by Guangdong Finance Trust Co., Ltd. in its capacity as trustee of Huitong 2018-3. The total collateral pool consisted of 69,488 loans with a balance of CNY4 billion at the 1 September 2018 cut-off date. KEY RATING DRIVERS Obligor Default Risk: Fitch assumes a lifetime default rate of 1.2% for GAC-Sofinco's portfolio to reflect the agency's expectations of asset-pool performance and applies a 7.5x stress multiple at 'AA+sf' on defaults to account for the absolute low base-case default rate, portfolio data limits due to the absence of a full economic cycle and the agency's view that emerging-market securitised assets are prone to higher stress than those in developed markets for the same rating category. Adequate Credit Enhancement, Liquidity Support: The notes are pass-through with a sequential payment structure. The transaction is supported by subordination, excess spread and a liquidity-reserve account. The liquidity reserve can cover at least three months of interest and expense payments after the first payment. The rated notes can withstand corresponding rating stresses applied in the cash flow analysis. Counterparty Risk: The transaction has structural mechanisms that ensure remedial action takes place should the fund custodian's rating fall below 'A-' or 'F1'. Fitch has assessed that the transaction is subject to commingling risk of 1.1% of the asset balance, which is accounted for it its cash flow analysis. Sector Outlook, Rating Cap: The asset outlook for the portfolio is stable. Fitch forecasts China's GDP growth of 6.1% in both 2019 and 2020. The 'AA+sf' expected note ratings reflect the cap on China's structured-finance transactions based on the country's developing securitisation market and Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating of 'A+'. EXPECTED RATING SENSITIVITIES Unexpected increases in defaults and unexpected decreases in recovery rates on defaulted loans could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case, which could result in negative rating action on the notes. Fitch has evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased gross default levels and decreased recovery rates over the life of the transaction. The analysis found that the class A notes are not affected, but the class B note ratings are susceptible to a downgrade to 'A-sf' in a severe default scenario where the base-case default rate increases by 100%, assuming all other factors remain constant. The ratings of class A and B notes are not affected by a decrease in recovery rates and remain at 'AA+sf' if the base-case recovery rate is reduced by 100%, assuming all other factors remain constant. Key rating drivers and expected rating sensitivities are further discussed in the corresponding presale report entitled ""Huitong 2018-3 Retail Auto Mortgage Loan Securitization Trust"", published today. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) disclosed in the offering document that relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under ""Related Research"" below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class, as detailed in the Special Report titled ""Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions,"" dated 31 May 2016. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch reviewed the results of a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information and concluded that there were no findings that affected the rating analysis. Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of GAC-Sofinco's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis: Static data provided by GAC-Sofinco from January 2012 to June 2018 Dynamic data provided by GAC-Sofinco from January 2012 to June 2018 Loan-by-loan interest rates breakdown from GAC-Sofinco as of 1 September 2018 Loan origination dates and amount from GAC-Sofinco as of 1 September 2018 Asset amortisation schedule from GAC-Sofinco starting from September 2018 Portfolio stratifications as of 1 September 2018 Capital structure information provided by GAC-Sofinco in September 2018 Transaction documentation provided by GAC-Sofinco in September 2018 The issuer has informed Fitch that not all relevant underlying information used in the analysis of the rated notes is public.

"SAN JOSE, March 13 (Reuters) - Costa Rica's coffee harvest jumped by 12% in the 2019-2020 season, recovering from a sharp fall in the previous period, the government said on Friday. During 2019-2020 the harvest rose to 1,915,959 bushels (46-kilo bags) up from 1,717,959 units the prior season, the Costa Rican presidency said in a statement. The harvest dropped by 14.6% on the year during the 2018-19 season. The rebound was spurred by efforts to develop strains more resistant to disease and climate change which had hurt productivity, said Xinia Chaves, executive director of the ICAFE coffee institute.

" (Recasts with midday prices, trader's quote)     By Mei Mei Chu     KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Malaysian palm oil futures reversed early losses on Wednesday on tightening supplies, but gains were capped by news of lower imports from India and Iran's missile attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq.     The benchmark palm oil contract for March delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange inched up 1 ringgit, or 0.03%, to 3,043 ringgit ($741.74) by the midday break.      ""The BMD market has traded sideways and marginally higher balancing concerns on reduced purchases from India and the Middle East tensions, versus the concerns on the Q1 2020 supply tightening in Malaysia and Indonesia,"" said Marcello Cultrera, institutional sales manager at Phillip Futures in Kuala Lumpur.     December production and stockpiles in Malaysia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil, likely fell 8.5% from November to its lowest in 27 months due to dry weather and lower fertiliser usage, a Reuters survey showed on Sunday.     Heavy downpours and flood concerns in Indonesia have also lowered 2019-20 production expectations in the world's top producer of palm oil, Refinitiv data showed.      While tighter supplies helped prices, markets were worried of a rise in freight charges in case a wider war in the Middle East disrupts shipment routes of palm oil, especially after Iran attacked American forces stationed in Iraq.      Separately, fears of an inventory build-up gained ground after India, the world's largest palm oil buyer, informally asked refiners and traders to avoid buying Malaysian palm oil following Kuala Lumpur's criticism of its actions in Kashmir and its new citizenship law.     Meanwhile, domestic demand is expected to increase with Malaysia expecting to absorb 500,000 tonnes more crude palm oil with the implementation of its B20 palm-based biodiesel programme this month.      Dalian's most-active soyoil contract rose 1.4%, while its palm oil contract also gained 1%. Soyoil prices on the Chicago Board of Trade was up 0.12%.      Palm oil is affected by price movements in related oils as they compete for a share in the global vegetable oils market.     Palm oil looks neutral in a zone of 3,004 ringgit-3,062 ringgit per tonne, and an escape could suggest a direction, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said.

"* U.S. air strike kills Iranian commander, rattle investors * US, German Bund yields tumble 6 bps * Spanish borrowing costs at 5-week low * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Updates price moves throughout, adds chart, comment) By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Government bond yields across the euro area fell on Friday after U.S. air strikes killed a top Iranian commander, heightening geopolitical tensions. Germany's 10-year safe-haven Bund yields slid to two-week lows, Spanish yields hit five-week lows and borrowing costs in Italy tumbled almost 10 basis points. The overnight attack, authorised by U.S. President Donald Trump, marked a dramatic escalation in a shadow war between Iran and the United States and its allies, principally Israel and Saudi Arabia. Iran on Friday threatened to hit back hard. Unease rippled across world markets, with oil prices soaring almost $3 and safe-haven assets such as the Swiss franc, Japanese yen and U.S. Treasuries rallying. ""Markets still remain quite thin after the holidays, but even in a regular session we would have seen a similar reaction,"" said Christian Lenk, a rates strategist at DZ Bank in Frankfurt. ""The repercussions from the air strike are not clearly forecastable and tensions remain high in the region."" Yields on German bonds, regarded as one of the safest assets in the world, were sharply lower across the curve. The 10-year Bund yield fell 7 basis points to a two-week low of -0.29%, 13 bps below seven-month highs hit just a day ago. Across the euro zone, 10-year bond yields fell 6-9 bps . U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit their lowest in three weeks at around 1.81%. The focus on geopolitics meant markets paid little attention to stronger-than-expected data from France, where inflation rose 1.6% year-on-year in December, beating analyst expectations for a 1.4% rise. State inflation data from Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, also had a muted impact. Signs that economic indicators are bottoming out and U.S./China trade tensions are easing have boosted hopes for growth and inflation in the euro zone -- pushing euro zone yields to multi-month highs just on Thursday. ""Even if you take geopolitics out, most of the positive news is there (in the price),"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier. ""But for me there is a natural boundary in how much interest rates can move higher -- we are not expecting a major ramp up in growth or inflation, inflation is way below target."" Spain's 10-year bond yield fell 7 bps to 0.38% following news that a Catalan separatist party plans to abstain during parliament's upcoming vote to confirm Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez as prime minister. The move could end a prolonged political deadlock that left Spain without a proper government for most of 2019.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10115677 Fitch Ratings-Chicago-March 31: Liquidity and FX risk are key credit considerations for Latin American corporates given the high business uncertainty, operational interruptions and market volatility caused by the coronavirus, says Fitch Ratings. Among more than 200 Fitch-rated issuers, liquidity for approximately 26% is low, 19% is average, 9% is above average and 46% is robust. Should respective currencies depreciate by 20%, leverage for the vast majority or more than 85% of the issuers would rise less than 0.5x or decline, less than 10% of issuers would experience a net debt/EBITDA increase of more than 1.0x, and 5% would see leverage rise 0.5x to 1.0x. Exporters and issuers with net cash positions are most resilient to currency pressures. Liquidity risk is highest for Argentina, as more issuers in the country have a liquidity ratio, defined as the sum of cash plus undrawn credit facilities/short-term debt, of less than 1.0x. AySA, Albanesi, CLISA and Genneia are examples. Liquidity risk is lowest for Mexico, as about 65% of issuers have a liquidity ratio above 3.0x. More than 50% of Mexican issuers have credit facilities to support liquidity. Some issuers, including Grupo Bimbo, Vale and Petrobras, have drawn down credit lines to bolster liquidity. <iframe src=""https://e.infogram.com/5fe10e95-b88d-45cb-acc8-86910cec7ff9?src=embed"" title=""LATAM Corp Liquidity Risk  CNT"" width=""550"" height=""444"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none;"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""> Fitch’s publicly-rated portfolio faces different levels of FX risks, in terms of both degree and direction. Exposure arises from currency mismatches in revenue and cost structure, and in the composition of debt obligations. Our FX screener examines the risks each issuer faces due to the weaknesses of local currencies, assuming all other circumstances remain unchanged. Many issuers, after a time lag, are able to pass through the effects of currency depreciation in the cost of goods sold and debt service to customers through higher prices. Although leverage for the vast majority of issuers would not be significantly affected by a 20% depreciation of the local currency, the effect for a few companies would be more outsized. Atento Luxco 1 and Grupo Famsa, for example, could experience a near 5.0x or greater effect on net leverage. As of March 31, the Brazilian real and Mexican peso both depreciated nearly 30% to BRL5.20/USD1.00 and MNN23.90/USD1.00, respectively, since YE 2019. <iframe src=""https://e.infogram.com/6f4639f7-9ca9-4abb-ac17-35ce18ab6f40?src=embed"" title=""Copy: LATAM Corp FX Risk  CNT"" width=""550"" height=""444"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none;"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""> Industry risk and rating headroom have also been evaluated as a part of our analysis. Industry risk has been classified as ‘high,’ ‘above average,’ ‘moderate,’ or ‘manageable’ and is considered high for airlines; gaming, lodging and leisure; oil & gas; and sugar & ethanol sectors. BNDES is likely to provide a bailout package for Brazilian airlines but the timing and extent of government support, among others, is a key watch item. Occupancy levels are a key watch item, among others, for hotels. All oil companies will need to significantly curtail capex this year in order to preserve liquidity, given waning global demand and increased world supply and our expectation this could keep Brent prices below USD40/bbl in 2020. Similarly, the pandemic has weakened sugar and ethanol prices. Most issuers do not have financial capacity to withstand a prolonged downturn so access to bank lending and lines of credit is one of the key items to watch. Currently, about 22% have exceeded the downgrade leverage trigger, while 18% of the issuers in Latin America have no downgrade leverage triggers. Among the remaining companies, 40% of the remaining 60% of issuers would pierce their downgrade leverage threshold with a drop in EBITDA of less than 20%. Another 35% would need a drop in EBITDA in the range of 20% to 50%, before crossing this downgrade threshold. This leaves 25% of the remaining group of issuers, or 15% of the overall portfolio, relatively immune to downgrade pressure based upon ratings headroom. Across the various countries, nearly 40% of Chilean issuers’ leverage is above the downgrade trigger. Examples include Enjoy in the high risk gaming, lodging and leisure sector. The company was downgraded to ‘B’ from ‘B+’ and placed on Rating Watch Negative last week.

"By Gwladys Fouche and Nerijus Adomaitis OSLO, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Russia was the likely culprit behind the disruption of GPS navigation signals over northern Scandinavia during recent NATO military exercises, Norway's defence minister said on Tuesday. Finland's air navigation services a week ago issued a warning to air traffic due to large-scale GPS interruption in the north of the country. Norway posted a similar warning at the end of October, days before the start of Trident Juncture, NATO's largest military exercise since the Cold War involving 50,000 troops in an area stretching from the Baltic Sea to Iceland. Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila said on Sunday it was ""possible that Russia has been the disrupting party in this. Russia is known to possess such capabilities."" The Kremlin dismissed Finland's allegations on Monday as groundless. ""We have the same problem (as Finland). We think it can also be part of a Russian exercise,"" Norwegian Defence Minister Frank Bakke-Jensen said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday. ""The first time it happened was during Zapad,"" he said, referring to a 2017 military exercise conducted by Russia and Belarus. ""Also on later occasions ... including during Trident Juncture,"" he said. Norway's defence ministry later told Reuters that jamming took place between Oct. 16 and Nov. 7, and was registered as coming from ""Russian land forces on the Kola Peninsula,"" a Russian region neighbouring Arctic Norway dotted with naval bases and restricted military zones. Trident Juncture ran for two weeks from Oct. 25. A command post exercise, involving commanders and their staffs at headquarters, will start on Thursday and last until Nov. 23. Bakken-Jensen was speaking on the margins of a meeting of Nordic defence ministers in Oslo. Nordic countries are tightening military cooperation at a time when security challenges are becoming more complex and demanding, according to a signed pledge. Norway, Denmark and Iceland are NATO members. Sweden and Finland are not, but have been cooperating more closely with NATO and their troops are taking part in Trident Juncture. Finnish Defence Minister Jussi Niinisto told Reuters on Tuesday he was concerned about the danger the GPS jamming posed to civilian traffic. ""It worries us that civilian airplanes suffered from this problem,"" he said, adding that he had raised the GPS issue at Tuesday's meeting. Norway had done the same, Bakke-Jensen said, adding that Oslo was worried because GPS is used by civilians such as fishermen, shippers and ambulance planes. Denmark's Defence Minister Claus Hjord Frederiksen said Russian denials of their involvement were not convincing and said the GPS jamming incident was another sign of Russia's ""aggressive"" behaviour towards neighbouring countries. ""If falls in line with the intimidation that they use all the time in the Baltic States, but also when we have ships in the Baltic Sea, and they sometimes simulate attacks against the ships,"" Frederiksen said.

"FOCA, Bosnia, May 4 (Reuters) - Thousands of Muslims flockedto the town of Foca on Saturday for the reopening of a historicmosque leveled at the beginning of the Bosnian war, in aceremony aimed at encouraging religious tolerance between deeplydivided communities. The 16th century Aladza Mosque was one of the most prominentmasterpieces of classical Ottoman architecture in the Balkansbefore its destruction in the 1992-95 war by Bosnian Serb forcestrying to carve out an ethnically ""pure"" state. The eastern town of Foca became notorious for the masspersecution and killings of non-Serbs that took place thereduring the conflict. Before the war, the Bosnian Muslims, or Bosniaks, made up 51percent of its 41,000 residents with the remainder mostly Serbs.Today, among some 18,000 residents, just over 1,000 Bosniaksremain. ""Everything that was connected to Islam, its civilisation orculture was destroyed,"" said 65-year-old Muslim worshipperSulejman Dzamalija. Sacred items dumped on rubbish tips have been restored andbuilt into the mosque ""to mark the start of a new era in thispart of the country,"" he said. Nestled in the valley by the Drina river, Aladza, also knownas the Colourful Mosque, was one of 17 Ottoman mosques in Foca.Five of them were destroyed during World War Two, while the 12remaining were demolished during the 1990 war. During the war, Bosnian Serbs authorities renamed the townSrbinje, but Bosnia's top court ordered the reinstatement of theoriginal name of Foca in 2004. Muhamed Jusic, the Foca assembly speaker, said thereconstructed mosque offered hope for the return of pre-warresidents and ""a new beginning in Foca"". Twenty four years on from the devastating war between itsMuslim Bosniaks, Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats, Bosniaremains split along ethnic lines, with rival groups blockingreconciliation and reform needed to join the European Union. ""Today we are witnessing a hope that people will again findpeace at this place,"" the head of Bosnia's Islamic CommunityHusein Kavazovic said at the ceremony. Work on rebuilding the mosque started in 2012 and wasfinanced by the governments of Turkey and the United States. ""Aladza should serve as a monument to resilience,reconciliation and diversity,"" said U.S. Ambassador Eric Nelson.

"* Salvini creates far-right alliance before EU vote * Expects EU rules to change in wake of May election * Far-right parties to stage Milan rally on Saturday By Sara Rossi and Crispian Balmer MILAN, May 17 (Reuters) - This month's European Parliamentelection will shake up the continent, leading to a relaxation ofbudget rules and influencing the choice of the next central bankchief, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said onFriday. League party leader Salvini is staging a rally on Saturdayof nationalist and far-right movements from 12 countries,looking to forge an alliance of eurosceptic groups that canshape policy-making across the 28-nation European Union. ""I think lots of things will change in Europe,"" Salvini toldReuters ahead of the rally, predicting that he and his allieswould win a significant number of seats in the new EuropeanParliament in the May 23-26 election. A number of top EU jobs will be up for grabs after the vote,including the president of the European Central Bank. Italy'sMario Draghi is due to leave the post later this year. France's Benoit Coeure and his compatriot Francois Villeroyde Galhau are among the frontrunners, while Germany's JensWeidmann is also seen as a potential candidate. Salvini said nothing should be taken for granted. ""We don'tnecessarily always have to chose between Paris and Berlin,"" hesaid. The European Parliament is consulted on who should takecharge of the ECB, but the final decision rests with EU leaders.Salvini hopes a strong showing by nationalists will give themgreater leverage when key posts get filled. TAX CUTS Earlier, speaking to a group of foreign reporters, Salvinisaid the next European Commission had to rewrite strict rulesthat set limits on budget deficits and debt, saying they were""strangling"" economic growth and causing unemployment. ""The eurosceptics, from my point of view, are those whogovern Europe now,"" he said, adding that he wanted to return to""pre-Maastricht rules"" when there were no limits on borrowing. Italy's government clashed with Brussels last year over itsbudget plans before finding a compromise. Salvini has suggestedthe coalition will ignore restraints in the 2020 budget, arguingthe priority was to boost growth. His comments this week pushed the spread between Italian andGerman bond yields to three-month highs. But Salvini was unrepentant, saying the only way to liftinvestor confidence in Italy was to revive thelong-underperforming economy. ""Reducing taxes is the only way to lower the spread as wellas debt and deficit, so they should allow us to cut taxes,"" hesaid. He said he also wanted the European Commission to present anew seven-year budget, branding current proposals""unacceptable"", including plans to cut agriculture spending, anddemanded an overhaul of EU banking rules. Italy has railed against EU rules covering failing banks,saying they unfairly penalised savers. The Italian government is facing a new banking headacheafter a private-sector deal aimed at safeguarding strugglingregional bank Carige collapsed earlier this month. Both the League and its coalition partner the 5-StarMovement denounced the previous government for using taxpayermoney to save other troubled banks. However, Salvini did notrule out state intervention for Carige. ""I hope there'll be a market solution.

"* Italy turbulence only latest example of massive mkt moves * Rising costs force banks to exit traditional middleman role * Experts say weak liquidity will increasingly inflame selloffs By Tommy Wilkes and Abhinav Ramnarayan LONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - Italy's recent bond market shock and pricing lurch was at least partly a function of years of attrition in global bond trading -- and it may be a precursor to bigger debt market bust-ups, according to investors. Liquidity - the ease with which assets can be bought or sold without moving the price sharply - has fallen across bond markets over the past decade. One reason is regulatory change introduced to prevent a repeat of 2008's serial banking collapses. Another is intervention by major central banks through quantitative easing (QE)-- massive bond-buying programmes. A big concern for years has been that another major world market hiatus would once again expose the vulnerability at the financial system's core, amplifying any global selloff. Liquidity hiccups have already roiled emerging and junk-rated bonds in recent years. But Italy's upheaval at the end of May showed that parts of the vast, historically stable market for Western sovereign bonds has also become prone to seizure whenever turbulence strikes. ""What happened in Italy should teach portfolio managers that liquidity comes at a price,"" Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy, a fund manager at BNP Paribas, said. Euro zone government bond trading volumes have nearly halved in the past four years to 676 billion euros in June, from 1.29 trillion euros in June 2014, data from Trax, a unit of bond trading platform MarketAxess, showed. Meanwhile, the bid-offer spread -- the difference between prices investors quote to buy and sell, a common liquidity gauge -- remains low but has widened. Even for Germany's 10-year Bund, the region's most-traded bond, bid-offer levels on cash prices are now 15 to 30 cents, compared with 5 to 10 cents from 2013 to 2015. Some of that slide was caused by the European Central Bank. Its 2.6 trillion-euro bond-buying scheme has swallowed a big chunk of new supply since 2015. With bond purchases ending this year, many expect liquidity to improve. That seems to have happened in U.S. markets since QE ended there. The average daily Treasury volumes in the first five months of 2018 rose 4.7 percent from the same period in 2017 to $554.3 billion, trade body Sifma says. But broadly, the liquidity drought is also symptomatic of a bigger problem after new rules effectively forced banks to reduce the pre-crisis ""market-making"" practice of holding bonds on their own books until buyers appear to lubricate trading. The Basel III rules, drawn up in 2009, forced banks to hold more capital against the risks they took, in turn making it costlier to hold inventories. Many see this as actually increasing market vulnerability. In the May 29 blowout, when buying interest for Italian debt evaporated, bid-offer yield spreads ballooned, peaking at 30 basis points versus 0-5 bps in normal times. Several banks have stepped back from primary dealing roles, partly due to regulatory pressures.. ""The role of market makers is still important, but you cannot rely on them,"" Lamy said. Some also blame the growing role of computer-powered high-frequency traders as market makers in place of banks; they are often accused of stopping quoting prices when spreads widen sharply. There are signs of reduced liquidity in the $5 trillion-a-day currency market, too. The sterling ""flash crash"" in October 2016 and the Swiss franc surge in January 2015 are prominent examples of recent liquidity squeezes. But two London-based bank FX trading heads said mini intra-day ""flash crash""-style moves occurred far more frequently than investors realised. Twice this year, the number of multiple standard-deviation moves - measuring unusually large price changes - across major bond, FX and stock markets has passed levels that were exceeded only twice in the preceding five years, Japanese bank Nomura estimates. ""All these bank risk rules ... means that some banks, when a certain security goes above a certain volatility, they stop quoting it,"" said Said Haidar, CEO of New York hedge fund Haidar Capital Management. ""That means some of the market-makers disappear from the market when you need liquidity most."" BALLOONING SPREADS Of May 29, as fears grew that Italy would quit the euro, dealers at banks and hedge funds painted a picture of a market in panic mode. The spike in short-dated Italian bond yields was the biggest since 1992, surpassing any day during the 2009-2013 European crisis. Kaspar Hense, a fund manager at $61 billion BlueBay Asset Management, said he watched Italian bid-offer spreads surge to between 15 and 20 basis points from the normal 2 to 3 bps as buyers and sellers disappeared. ""Normally you wouldn't even trade an asset with that sort of spread,"" Hense said. Even now, selling a big tranche of Italian debt, say $200 million worth, remains near-impossible and ""fruitless"", said Louis Gargour, CIO of hedge fund LNG Capital. That was not the case in previous years, Gargour said, adding: ""If you are a large fund, selling significant amount of BTPs (Italian government bonds) into market weakness is difficult and is likely to exaggerate price moves against you."" DISAPPEARING INVENTORY Current data on European banks' bond-trading inventories is difficult to find, but the Bank for International Settlements estimated in 2016 that U.S. primary dealers had cut net Treasuries positions by nearly 80 percent since 2013. And dealers' holdings of U.S. corporate bonds are now less than one percent of the total outstanding, versus 10 percent in 2008, Gavekal Research said. What's of concern is that recent episodes of disappearing liquidity -- February's volatility spike and a late-2016 sterling ""flash crash"" - happened during a multi-year bull run on world markets. Now with economic growth possibly slowing and central banks withdrawing stimulus, the next hit may strike when the market backdrop is less benign.

For downloadable graphics, please visit www.pewtrusts.org/stateline) By Tim Henderson Sept 11 (Stateline) - An oil and gas bonanza in Southwestern states may be helping to drive the continuing national economic boom. The nation’s 4.2 percent growth in GDP, estimated last month by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, is the highest quarterly growth since 2014. State estimates aren’t due until mid-November, but many experts see oil and natural gas drilling, driven by higher prices, as a leading reason. “The states that contribute most might be the ones with strong increases in energy production,” including Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, said Mark Perry, an economist at the University of Michigan and an economic analyst for the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. GDP measures gross domestic product, or the value of all goods and services produced in a given period of time. Oil and gas industries benefited from rising prices over the past two years, prompting more production and jobs. Production increased by nearly half in New Mexico over the past year, 29 percent in Texas and Colorado, and 19 percent in North Dakota and Oklahoma, according to federal figures as of June. Natural gas production surged in Louisiana as well. Tech companies, the leading driver in California’s recent economic growth, also show no sign of slowing down, said Lynn Reaser, chairwoman of the state treasurer’s Council of Economic Advisers. Tech also boomed in New York, Colorado and Pennsylvania earlier this year, and nationally it continues to surge to levels not seen since 2001. Energy and tech have been major factors in state and local economies since the early 2000s, according to a study last year from the left-leaning Brookings Institution. Almost all the fast-growing economies have one or both factors in their favor. New Mexico expects almost $1.2 billion in extra tax revenue because of oil and gas next year, after struggling to make ends meet in the current budget, and is planning to set up a rainy day fund to help ease future downturns, said Jeffrey Mitchell, director of the University of New Mexico’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research. While oil and gas drilling has been concentrated near the Texas border, jobs in the state’s largest city, Albuquerque, also have seen an upturn, he said. “The situation was bleak,” Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, recalled in her state of the state speech this year. “We find ourselves in a much different position today.” Texas’ state budget is also expecting a surplus: an increase in oil and gas taxes of about $2 billion to be split between a rainy day fund and a highway fund, said Chris Bryan, spokesman for the state Comptroller of Public Accounts. The Texas economy has become more diversified with tech and health care, and is more likely to survive cyclical slowdowns, Bryan said. California projects a $9 billion surplus. Demand for technology helped spur California job growth in the second quarter, along with health care and tourism, Reaser said. “California is weathering tensions on global growth and trade,” she said. Texas and New Mexico had the largest recent increases in oil production because of rich supplies in the Permian Basin, an underground formation spanning the two states. But state and local policy also has played a role, said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, a Denver-based oil and gas trade group. “The states that have seen significant gains have reasonable policies that enable development to move forward,” Sgamma said. “Contrast that with California, which has put up multiple obstacles and as a result has slipped in the rankings.” California ranked third last year in oil production, but was surpassed this year by New Mexico and Oklahoma and now ranks fifth at about 462,000 barrels a day as of June, according to federal figures. Lawmakers in California voted in May to ban new offshore drilling in state-controlled waters. Environmental groups have called on California’s Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown to freeze and then phase out oil and gas production in the state, though Brown has resisted the idea. While the economic news was mostly good at midyear, in some ways the second quarter is an aberration, said Paul Flora, an analyst for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who studies state economies, adding that growth in GDP is likely to slow. Wyoming and Alaska had some of the biggest economic turnarounds this year, with oil and gas profits driving big increases in economic output after losses between 2016 and 2017. Oil drilling and production is behind Wyoming’s rebound, said Wenlin Liu, the state’s chief economist. It’s bringing more production but less employment gain than earlier oil booms, Liu said. “After the downturn in 2015 and 2016, the oil and gas industry got a lot more efficient in their operation with more automation,” Liu said. “The growth in oil and gas employment is a lot slower.” Nationally, jobs in the mining sector, which includes oil and gas, grew by 17,000 since April, dwarfed by business services, which added 186,000 jobs, and construction, which added 79,000 jobs. States with the largest annual job growth as of July were Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Texas and Washington, all of which saw annual job growth of more than 3 percent. https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/09/11/states-see-energy-boom-along-with-economic-expansion",STATELINE-States See Energy Boom Along With Economic Expansion,"the nation’s 4.2 percent growth in gdp , estimated last month by the bureau of economic analysis , is the highest quarterly growth since 2014. many experts see oil and natural gas drilling , driven by higher prices , as a leading reason. “the states that contribute most might be the ones with strong increases in energy production ,” said mark perry.",stateline-oil and gas boom in the southwest may be driving u.s . economic growth
"(Adds details on results; compares with estimates) July 25 (Reuters) - Husky Energy Inc reported abetter-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, as higherCanadian crude prices following Alberta government's mandatoryoutput cuts more than offset the company's lower production andweak refining margins. The Calgary-based company said average realized prices rose7.3% to $53.35 per barrel of oil equivalent after the mandatorycurtailment on oil production during the quarter to ease exportpipeline congestion. Husky's average quarterly production fell 9.2% to 268,400barrels of oil equivalents a day in the reported quarter as thecompany complied with the curtailments. The government's move has been a shot in the arm for someproducers, but been detrimental to some integrated companiessuch as Husky Energy and Imperial Oil, which benefitfrom low-cost oil to run through their refineries. Average realized U.S. refining and marketing margin fell to$14.16 per barrel of oil in the quarter from $16.66 a yearearlier. Husky's throughput, the amount of crude processed at itsrefineries, also fell 4.2% to 340,000 barrels per day due toplanned turnarounds at two of its refineries and as operationsremained suspended at another refinery.

"By Jack Tarrant TOKYO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Stockholm and an Italian two-city bid made presentations to host the 2026 Winter Games on Wednesday with both embracing the IOC's 'The New Norm' programme which is aimed at making it cheaper and easier to stage the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) faces its most serious bidding crisis in decades after several cities dropped out of the 2026 race, leaving just two candidates. The IOC has called The New Norm ""an ambitious set of 118 reforms that reimagines how the Olympic Games are delivered"". On the first day of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) General Assembly, the Italian bid of Milan-Cortina D'Ampezzo said 93 percent of its venues would be temporary or already exist. “We are interpreting the new rules to put together a big city like Milan and then the mountains, avoiding throwing away money and making a very sustainable offer,” Milan mayor Guiseppe Sala told Reuters after the presentation. Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto region, said there would be no ""white elephants"", whilst the Italians claimed 83 percent of Milan's citizens favoured the bid. Italian Olympic Committee President Giovanni Malago said giving a winter Olympics to countries such as Sweden or Italy, with their rich history of winter sports and pre-existing venues, was the future of Olympic bidding under The New Norm. Stockholm’s bid also played on themes of sustainability. “I think The New Norm and the new terms of organising Olympic Games definitely fits into our way of thinking,” Swedish Olympic Committee chief Mats Arjes said after the presentation. The Italian bid is far from guaranteed enough political support amid the country’s financial woes, while Stockholm faces opposition from a new city government which said last month it would not back a bid that includes taxpayer funding. The IOC will elect the winners in June, 2019.

"By David Morgan WASHINGTON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives plan to unveil another round of tax cuts this week, hoping to draw a sharp contrast between themselves and Democrats ahead of the Nov. 6 congressional elections. Republican lawmakers and strategists say a new tax debate should amplify the party's upbeat economic message, touting a report by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation that forecast the creation of 1.5 million jobs and wage increases if individual tax cuts in last year's tax reform bill were made permanent. ""Anytime we're talking about tax cuts and the growing economy, we're winning,"" said Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party's main campaign support for House Republican candidates. But experts say House Republican leaders could have trouble mustering the 216 votes needed to pass the measure, given the prospect of widening the federal budget deficit already swollen by a round of tax cuts in December. And some Republicans from Democratic-leaning states worry that constituents already dislike December's cap on the federal deduction for state and local tax payments, known as SALT. ""Adding another several hundred billion dollars to the deficit is something that I think some Republicans are going to really think hard about,"" said John Gimigliano, who heads federal tax legislative and regulatory services at the audit, tax and advisory firm KPMG LLP. ""Passage is not automatic,"" he added. A dozen House Republicans opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last December. All but one were from the high-tax Democratic states of New York, New Jersey and California. If successful in the House, the legislation would not likely be taken up in the Senate soon, though experts believe provisions on retirement savings and tax assistance for start-up companies could find bipartisan support eventually. Dubbed ""Tax Reform 2.0"", the House package is intended to augment President Donald Trump's 2017 tax overhaul, which added $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit by providing permanent tax cuts for U.S. corporations, but only temporary individual tax cuts that are set to expire after 2025. Republicans insist Trump's tax overhaul and actions to deregulate industry are boosting the economy. But that has been undercut on the campaign trail by worries about Trump's policy on trade tariffs and a lack of evidence that tax cuts have delivered promised pay increases to workers. Democrats, who opposed last year's bill, have also cast Republican tax cuts as a giveaway to big corporations and the rich that will lead to cuts in Social Security and Medicare, claims that Republicans deny. The new legislation would add another $576 billion to the deficit, even taking potentially higher economic growth into account, the Tax Foundation said. That number could rise if Republicans made an estimated $1.1 trillion in individual tax cuts permanent, but scaled back or eliminated the SALT deduction cap, which is a revenue raiser. ""If this were likely to be enacted in the near term, those numbers would be difficult to square,"" said David Noren, a tax partner with the law firm McDermott, Will & Emery. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, the 2.0 package's main author, plans to unveil draft language for three bills early in the week and put it to a committee-level vote on Thursday, with a full House vote following by Oct 1. Aside from making individual tax cuts permanent, Republicans say the legislation will including savings provisions intended to help small businesses offer 401(k) retirement plans, allow 529 education savings plans to pay for apprenticeships and provide access to retirement savings for costs related to births and adoptions. Republicans say the legislation will also seek to encourage start-up businesses by allowing them to write off more start-up costs and add investors without limiting tax benefits, such as research and development credits.

Once a sprawling retail conglomerate, Metro has in recent years been restructuring to focus on its core cash-and-carry business, selling off the Kaufhof department stores and then splitting from consumer electronics group Ceconomy. The consortium offered Metro total cash proceeds of significantly more than 500 million euros ($554.15 million) for Real in July. A spokesman for X+Bricks declined to comment on the amount of the new offer for the chain, which has around 34,000 employees. Metro said the consortium had registered its interest in Real again and signalled it would improve its offer. Metro also said it aimed to complete talks with real estate investor Redos, which is leading another consortium seeking to buy Real, in the coming weeks. A Redos spokesman said it took note of the new offer from the X+Bricks consortium and would continue negotiations.

"BEIJING, Dec 4 (Reuters) - North Korea's foreign minister will visit China this week for three days to meet senior officials and discuss the situation on the Korean peninsula, China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday. China is North Korea's most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite its anger at the country's nuclear and missile programmes. Ties have warmed in the last year, as Pyongyang's relations with both Seoul and Washington have also improved dramatically. Ri Yong Ho will also meet the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, during a visit set to run from Thursday until Saturday, said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the foreign ministry. The two will have a ""deep exchange of views"" on China-North Korea relations, the situation on the Korean peninsula and other issues of mutual concern, Geng told a daily news briefing, without giving details. The visit will have a positive effect on promoting ties, as well as on communication and cooperation on Korean peninsula and other issues, he added. Geng declined to comment when asked if the two sides would discuss plans for a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to North Korea, saying he had no information he could provide. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has visited China three times this year for meetings with Xi. Diplomatic sources say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon.

"By Saeed Azhar, Marwa Rashad and Pamela Barbaglia DUBAI/RIYADH/LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has shown no interest so far in financing Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk's proposed $72 billion deal to take the U.S. electric car maker private, despite acquiring a minority stake in the company this year, two sources familiar with the matter said. The 47-year-old investor and engineer stunned financial markets on Tuesday when he said on Twitter that he was considering a take-private deal for Tesla, an auto manufacturing pioneer that developed the world's first luxury all-electric sedan car. He also said he had secured funding for the proposal, without providing details. Investors and analysts viewed PIF as a natural financing partner. Beyond amassing a stake of just below 5 percent in Tesla, the sovereign wealth fund has poured tens of billions of dollars into technology investments, including $45 billion in SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund over five years. However, a source who is familiar with PIF's strategy said it was not currently getting involved in any funding process for Tesla's take-private deal. A second source close to the situation also said PIF was not taking part in any such plan at this stage. This source said that the Saudi fund would not make an investment of this kind without seeking guidance first from Softbank. Reuters reported on Wednesday that SoftBank was not currently pursuing a deal for Tesla given its investment earlier this year in rival GM Cruise. PIF's reluctance will add to the pressure on Musk to produce details of his financing plan. Tesla's board has not received a detailed financing plan from him and is seeking more information, Reuters reported on Thursday. The board will make a decision on whether to hire advisers and launch a formal review of Musk's take-private proposal in the coming days, based on how much detail on the financing plan it receives from Musk, a third source said. The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. A spokesman for PIF was not immediately available for comment. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment on behalf of the company and Musk. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has contacted Tesla to ask about Musk's assertion on Twitter that funding for his proposed deal was ""secured"", the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Tesla is facing a make-or-break moment in its eight-year history as a public company, as competition from European automakers is poised to intensify with new electric vehicles from Mercedes, Audi, BMW and other rivals. Taking Tesla private would remove the pressure from Musk coming from hedge funds betting that the company's stock will drop given its production issues and negative cash flow. It would also remove the company from the glare of Wall Street that comes with reporting quarterly earnings publicly. In a letter to employees on Tuesday, Musk suggested a choice for shareholders of selling their shares for $420 each or remaining investors in a private Tesla. Musk has also said he would be looking to keep his ownership of Tesla at around 20 percent in a buyout deal, and that a special purpose vehicle, like the one that exists at his aerospace company SpaceX, would allow Tesla shareholders to remain invested if they so choose. Investment bankers and analysts have so far reacted with scepticism, telling Reuters it would be hard for Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $22 billion, to raise the equity and debt financing needed for the deal given Tesla is not turning a profit. Some analysts have suggested that Musk could convince Tesla's top shareholders, such as Fidelity Investments and China's Tencent, to roll their equity stakes into the deal, thereby significantly reducing the amount of money needed to be raised. However, the deal structure would come with big logistical and legal challenges when it comes to buying out smaller shareholders, analysts have said.

"(Adds details and background) Dec 6 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and bluebird bio Inc said on Friday their experimental therapy for a type of multiple myeloma met the main goal in a mid-stage study. Shares of bluebird rose 5.5% to $83.75 in trading after the bell. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the therapy, Ide-cel, in patients who had received three prior treatments for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the white blood cells, the companies said. Patients across three doses of the therapy had an overall response rate of 73.4%. The therapy also demonstrated a median progression free survival of 8.6 months, the companies said in a statement. The therapy belongs to a class of drugs known as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy or CAR-T, which involves drawing white blood cells from a patient, processing them in the lab to target cancer, and infusing the cells back into the patient. The drug targets a protein linked to multiple myeloma known as BCMA. The safety profile of the therapy was consistent with the data in prior studies, the companies said. ""We are encouraged by these data, especially the outcomes observed at the highest target dose,"" Kristen Hege, senior vice president of oncology and cell therapy development at Bristol-Myers said in a statement.

"(Adds comment from victim's brother) By Omar Younis SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Sept 3 (Reuters) - Federal safetyinvestigators on Tuesday promised an exhaustive probe into thefire that killed 34 people on a dive boat as many of the charredbodies remained trapped in the sunken wreckage off theCalifornia coast or missing in the ocean. After recovering the remains of 20 people from the 75-foot(23-meter) Conception or from the waters where the dive shipsank off Santa Cruz Island, officials said they believed none ofthe 14 victims initially classified as missing had survived thefast-moving flames. ""There were several other victims that were seen by thedivers - between four and six - that are still between thewreckage, but due to the position of the boat they were unableto be recovered before nightfall,"" Santa Barbara County SheriffBill Brown told reporters. ""Today, efforts will be made to stabilize the boat so thatdivers can safely enter it, search it and recover additionalvictims,"" he said. The five survivors, including the boat's captain and fourcrew members, were above deck when the blaze broke out at about3:15 a.m. Pacific time and escaped in an inflatable boat. A crewmember who perished was apparently sleeping below deck with thepassengers at the time. National Transportation Safety Board member Jennifer Homendysaid 16 investigators were already assigned to the probe,including specialists in operations, engineering, survivalfactors and fire analysis. The investigators will collect all perishable evidence whileon scene for at least a week, she said, but the Conception wouldremain on the ocean floor, more than 60 feet below the surface,until a site survey had been completed. A few scant details about the victims, who ranged in agefrom 17 to 60, began to emerge as emergency workers planned touse DNA analysis https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-fire-dna/california-investigators-to-use-war-zone-dna-analysis-technique-to-identify-boat-fire-victims-idUSKCN1VO2O2to identify the remains of the 20 bodies recovered so far.Most of the victims were from the Santa Cruz andSan Jose area, authorities said.

""It’s just such a horrific notion to think what the peopledown in the below decks, the people sleeping down there musthave gone through,"" said Judy Weisman, 72. ""How terrifying."" An audio recording of a desperate call made to the U.S.Coast Guard as flames engulfed the boat offered a glimpse intothat terror as a man could be heard pleading for help. ""Mayday, mayday, mayday!"" he said in the garbled recordingof the call. ""That's a distress, this is the Coast Guard Sector LosAngeles on channel 1-6, what is your position ... and number ofpersons on board? Over,"" the dispatcher answered. ""Twenty-nine. Twenty-nine POB,"" said the man, using theabbreviation for ""people on board"" a vessel. ""I can't breathe!... Twenty-nine POB."" The dispatcher requested the GPS location of the vessel atleast two more times but the caller apparently failed torespond. Marine biologist Kristy Finstad, 41, was leading the divetrip on the Conception, according to her brother, BrettHarmeling. Finstad co-owned Worldwide Diving Adventures, whichhad chartered the boat for a three-day excursion to the ChannelIslands. ""No final word on my sister Kristy; however it is likely shehas transitioned to be with the good lord,"" Harmeling said in aFacebook post on Tuesday.

"By Marilynn Larkin NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A network meta-analysis suggeststhat lidocaine-prilocaine is more effective than some otheranalgesic options for relieving pain during insertion of anintrauterine device (IUD); however, more studies are needed toconfirm the cream's effectiveness and safety, researchers say. ""The number of unintended pregnancies continues to riseworldwide, especially in developing countries, which are theones desperate to control such a problem,"" Dr. Hisham Haggag ofCairo University said in an email to Reuters Health. ""The main reason for this is the lack of efficient birthcontrol programs in these countries,"" he said. ""The IUD remainsthe most important and most popular form of contraception...asit is simple, effective and relatively inexpensive, in additionto providing long-term reversible contraception."" ""One of the main limiting factors...regarding this method ispain or simply fear of pain,"" he noted. Dr. Haggag and colleagues reviewed placebo-controlledrandomized trials of women undergoing IUD insertion withdifferent pain-relief medications. Thirty-eight trials involving6,314 women were included. One trial assessed the analgesic effect of a 10-mL lidocaineparacervical block, 400 mg of misoprostol, or 550 mg ofnaproxen; 13 looked at lidocaine alone; 11 assessed cervicalripening with 400 or 600 mg of misoprostol; three evaluated 800mg ibuprofen; two tested 550 mg of naproxen; two looked at 20 mgof ketorolac; two assessed lidocaine 2.5% plus prilocaine 2.5%cream to the cervix; and four evaluated other forms ofanalgesia, such as lavender scent. As reported online January 2 in Fertility and Sterility,despite substantial variation among the studies and findings,the network meta-analysis showed that lidocaine-prilocaine cream(genital mucosal application) statistically significantlyreduced pain at tenaculum placement compared with placebo (meandifference, - 2.38). Further, the cream ranked highest withrespect to reducing tenaculum placement pain, followed byparacervical lidocaine. Similarly, the cream ranked highest treatment in painreduction during IUD insertion, again followed by paracervicallidocaine. ""We believe our meta-analysis provides solid evidence thatlidocaine-procaine creams should be used for pain control, andsuch a simple and relatively inexpensive method should be aroutine step, not an optional step, in IUD insertion programs,""Dr. Haggag said. But that does not rule out other methods of pain control, henoted. ""We strongly recommend that this not (be) the only step.The pain threshold differs between women regardless of theirculture, ethnic or genetic backgrounds. Using this cream mightbe supplemented with other anesthetics if needed. The ultimategoal is providing the procedure with the least possible pain ordiscomfort."" Dr. Jonathan Schaffir, an ob/gyn at The Ohio StateUniversity Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, told ReutersHealth by email, ""Inserting an IUD is a minor procedure that iswell-tolerated by most women in the office with only mild tomoderate temporary discomfort."" ""However, because of the pain involved - particularly foryoung women or for women who have never given birth - it wouldbe helpful to have a treatment that removes or minimizes thispain to make it an even more appealing birth control option,"" headded. The authors suggest that most interventions have not shown adefinite improvement over using a placebo, he said, ""with theexception of lidocaine-prilocaine cream, which ... is applied tothe surface of the cervix before the IUD is inserted."" ""However, the details of using this technique make me a bitskeptical of the findings,"" he continued. Among 38 differenttrials involving over 6,300 women, only two trials of 212 womencompared the cream with placebo. ""With larger trials similar inscope to the others quoted, the improvements that were seen inthese two trials might be much less."" ""Also, the trials describe applying the cream and thenwaiting seven minutes,"" Dr. Schaffir said. ""One paperspecifically states that they leave the speculum in for theentire time that the cream is in place. For many women, theprospect of enduring a speculum exam for that long may be as bador worse than putting up with the insertion process, whichtypically takes less than one minute."" Discussing available options for pain relief may beappropriate when counseling women about the IUD,"" he concluded.""Hopefully, future research will determine the optimal techniquefor minimizing pain associated with IUD insertion for women whoneed it.""

"By Anthony Esposito and Ana Isabel Martinez MEXICO CITY, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Ivan Archivaldo Guzman, the leader of Los Chapitos wing of the Sinaloa Cartel, was behind the assault on security forces that prompted the release of his half-brother from a house in the city of Culiacan last week, a top Mexican official said. The men's father is Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, Mexico's most infamous drug kingpin, who himself slipped away from authorities on multiple occasions before being sentenced to life imprisonment in the United States this year. Younger brother Ovidio Guzman was briefly captured by Mexican security forces on Oct. 17 in an upscale neighborhood of Culiacan, until hundreds of heavily-armed Sinaloa Cartel gunmen forced his release. The botched raid has called into question Mexico's security strategy and put pressure on President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has insisted that the release was necessary to protect the lives of civilians and security personnel. Questions have circulated about the role of the older Guzman brother in launching the fierce counterattack led by gunmen in armored vehicles armed with mounted weapons that left parts of the city smoldering. Late on Thursday, Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said Ivan Archivaldo had played a key part. ""He was one of those leading the mobilization of various criminal elements in Culiacan,"" Durazo said, while denying reports that the elder brother had also been briefly captured. ""Ivan Archivaldo was not at the home that was taken over by (security) personnel who participated in this operation,"" he said. A senior security official told Reuters that Ovidio was found in the house with his partner, their two daughters, and two guards. The official asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The Sinaloa Cartel, along with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, are Mexico's largest and most powerful drug trafficking organizations. Since El Chapo left the scene, his partner Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada has taken on a coordinating ""godfather"" role overseeing several factions in the organization, an official at the U.S. Justice Department told Reuters. Four brothers, led by Ivan Archivaldo, form one group collectively known as Los Chapitos, or ""little Chapos."" El Chapo's brother heads another unit, and veteran trafficker Rafael Caro-Quintero leads another, the official said. In a 2018 interview with a Mexican magazine, Caro-Quintero denied he was still a drug trafficker.

"* Asian stock markets : https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * S&P 500 futures bounce 1% after Monday plunge * Markets wary of pandemic risk, damage to world economy * Nikkei pares early losses amid report of vaccine trials * Bonds fly as investors wager on central bank, fiscal stimulus * Oil led commodities lower on demand fears By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Asian share markets were trying to stabilise on Tuesday after a wave of early selling petered out and Wall Street futures managed a solid bounce, allowing investors to take a break from coronavirus fears. Some dealers cited a Wall Street Journal report on a possible vaccine as helping sentiment, though human tests of the drug might not start until the end of April. Whatever the cause, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 bounced 1% to pare some of the steep 3.35% loss the cash index suffered overnight. South Korea's hard-hit market edged up 0.8% and helped MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fight back to flat. Japan's Nikkei was still down 2.8%, but just catching up to the global sell-off having been shut on Monday. Shanghai blue chips eased 0.7% but also off early lows. European and U.S. stocks had suffered their biggest loses since mid-2016 amid fears the coronavirus was morphing into a pandemic that could cripple global supply chains and wreak far greater economic damage than first thought. The risks were such that bond markets were wagering central banks would have to ride to the rescue with new stimulus. Futures for the Federal Reserve funds rate have surged in the last few days to price in a 50-50 chance of a quarter-point rate cut as early as April. In all, they imply more than 50 basis points of reductions by year end. Central banks across Asia have already been easing policy, while governments have promised large injections of fiscal stimulus, something western countries might also have to consider. The Dow had ended Monday down 3.55%, while the S&P 500 lost 3.35% and the Nasdaq 3.71%. Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, jumped to its highest close since early 2019. Underlining the economic impact of the virus was a 3.5% drop in Apple Inc as data showed sales of smartphones in China tumbled by more than a third in January. BONDS BAY FOR RATE CUTS The coronavirus death toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, feeding worries it could turn into a pandemic. ""If travel restrictions and supply chain disruptions spread, the impact on global growth could be more widespread and longer lasting,"" said Jonas Glotermann at Capital Economics. ""While we still think that it would take a significant deterioration in the outlook for the U.S. economy for policymakers to cut rates, they may feel compelled to do so if the virus spreads and leads to continued falls in the stock market and inversion of the Treasury yield curve."" The rush to bonds left yields on 10-year Treasury notes at 1.40%, down almost 20 basis points in just three sessions and paying less than overnight rates. Yields were now rapidly approaching the all-time low of 1.321% hit in July 2016. The sharp drop, combined with the simple fact the Fed had far more room to cut rates than its peers, kept the U.S. dollar restrained after a run of strong gains. The euro edged up a little from recent three-year lows to reach $1.0858, while the dollar was back at 110.90 yen and away from a 10-month top of 112.21. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was all but steady at 99.288. Gold ran into profit-taking after hitting a seven-year peak overnight, and was last at $1,649.80 an ounce. Oil steadied after shedding nearly 4% on Monday. U.S. crude was up 22 cents at $51.65, while Brent crude firmed 28 cents to $56.58.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-New York-February 26: Canada's proposed revised liquidity adequacyrules could pressure earnings and competitive positioning of smaller banks andalternative lenders that may be more reliant on brokered deposit funding thantheir large competitors, Fitch Ratings says. However, if implemented, theproposal would be positive for banking system stability as it would requirebanks to hold higher percentages of liquid assets against six categories ofriskier retail deposits. The preservation of capital and liquidity is viewed positively from a creditperspective. However, smaller banks and those with less reliable fundingprofiles could be negatively impacted depending on their liquidity levels and towhat extent the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI)increases the severity of runoff assumptions for online and third-party brokereddeposits. Although smaller and/or internet banks such as Simplii and Tangerinecurrently hold elevated levels of liquidity, the new rules could limit long-termloan asset growth under their current deposit raising strategies. The OSFI proposal, which aims to shore up the liquidity of less-stable deposits,would increase the estimated runoff rates, or the percentage of retail depositsvulnerable to withdrawal under a stress scenario. Under the proposal, bankswould be required to hold liquid assets of up to 40% of high interest savingsaccounts or deposits sourced from third parties, depending on particularcharacteristics. Currently, runoff rates for all categories of deposits rangebetween 3% and 10%. In a hypothetical case where a bank held the minimum liquidity coverage, andwhere estimated runoff rates of deposits rose up to 40% from 10%, the new rulewould require the bank to increase its high-quality liquid assets as apercentage of total assets, reducing interest earning assets by an equal amount.All else equal, net interest income would fall in proportion to there-allocation of earning assets to non-earning, high-quality liquid assets(HQLAs). <iframesrc=""https://e.infogram.com/430c11b7-f7fd-4986-86de-c1d01f7649c9?src=embed""title=""Kaster - Canadian Run-Off Rates "" width=""550"" height=""613"" scrolling=""no""frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none;"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""> The categories of deposits targeted by OSFI for higher runoff are either morerate-sensitive than other deposits or less anchored by an established bankingrelationship that includes other financial services. Banks are required to holdsufficient HQLAs to cover potentially higher deposit outflows and maturingobligations over a 30-day period. Potential liquidity concerns were highlighted with the 2017 run on deposits atHome Trust, a subsidiary of mortgage lender Home Capital, which raised a largeproportion of its term deposits through banks and financial advisers. The OFSIhas established a comment period through March 2019. The proposal follows the 25basis-point increase in the domestic stability buffer, an adjustable capitalrequirement imposed on systemic banks in December 2018. <a href= https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/10056987>Related Content: FitchRatings: Canada Boosts Bank Capital Requirements While U.S. Eases Contact: Mark Narron Director, Financial Institutions Fitch Ratings, Inc. 33 Whitehall Street New York, NY 10004 +1 212 612-7898 Foster Cheng Director, Financial Institutions 120 Adelaide St W #2500 Toronto, ON M5H 1T1 +1 416 644-1572 Laura Kaster, CFA Senior Director, Fitch Wire +1 646 582-4497 Media Relations: Hannah James, New York, Tel: +1 646 582 4947, Email:hannah.james@thefitchgroup.com.

"TOKYO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The incoming CEO of Tokio MarineHoldings Inc said on Monday the insurer will activelypursue mergers and acquisitions (M&A) opportunities overseas tofurther diversify its geographic footprint. ""Valuations of companies, or deal prices, have becomeexpensive given excess of (global) money. But if there is areally good company and a good chance, we would like to try,""Satoru Komiya told a news conference. Komiya, currently senior managing director, was named tobecome CEO of Japan's largest property-and-casualty insurer,succeeding Tsuyoshi Nagano. The change will be effective afterthe company's annual shareholder meeting in June. Tokio Marine is the most aggressive and successful inoverseas M&A among Japan's insurers. Since Nagano took over thehelm in 2013, it has made a string of deals, including buyingU.S. specialty insurer HCC Insurance Holdings for $7.5 billionin 2015. Tokio Marine and rival property-and-casualty insurers havebeen accelerating overseas expansion to diversify their riskexposure geographically, so that a natural disaster hitting aparticular region could be offset by profits from other areas. The need for the overseas buildup is felt keenly by theJapanese insurers in recent years as the archipelago has beenhit by powerful typhoons and earthquake. Last year, a powerful typhoon caused massive damages inwestern Japan in September. The property-and-casualty insuranceindustry body estimates total insurance payouts to be around 585billion yen ($5.34 billion) for the typhoon, the biggest forwind and flood damages in Japan. For the six months ended in September last year, TokioMarine's domestic property-casualty insurance business sufferedlosses after booking hefty natural disaster insurance payouts,while its overseas business made a steep profit increase. It's not just property-and-casualty insurers in Japan whoare seeking growth overseas through M&A deals. Earlier onMonday, the president of Japan's largest life insurer, NipponLife Insurance Co, said his company is activelyseeking deals overseas, with a focus on the United States andAsia's emerging economies.

"(Recasts, updates prices, adds details/quote; changes dateline) By Maytaal Angel LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Copper headed for a fifth weekly loss on Friday as trade tensions between the United States and China rumbled on, while aluminium hit a three-month low ahead of a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump and Putin are due to meet in Helsinki on Monday and aluminium investors are looking for any hint that U.S. sanctions on Rusal, the world's second-biggest aluminium producer, will be eased or lifted. ""There's an expectation that if you're going to see the sanctions removed from Rusal it may come out of the meeting (between Trump and Putin),"" said Nick Snowdon, metals strategist at Deutsche Bank. Regarding the trade dispute between the United States and China, he said that speculative investors in copper are neutrally positioned, reflecting a cautious attitude amid economic uncertainty. ""In copper you had probably the single largest (long) position ever liquidated (on the Shanghai Futures Exchange) in June. That's done and dusted, so that (trade) uncertainty (now) lends itself to investors staying on the sidelines and prices stabilising."" COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.5 percent at $6,200 a tonne by 1013 GMT, having hit a one-week low this week. The metal has fallen more than 15 percent in five weeks of losses. ALUMINIUM: Aluminium edged up 0.2 percent to $2,046 a tonne, having hit its lowest since early April at $2,021.50. ALUMINIUM TECHNICALS: Indicating nearby tightness, cash aluminium traded at a premium of $49.50 a tonne to the three-month price, its highest level since early April. <CMAL0-3> CHINA TRADE SURPLUS: China's trade surplus with the United States swelled to a record in June, a result that could further inflame a bitter trade dispute with Washington.

The carrier operating under the brand Vivo aims to liftprices in the postpaid mobile sector - in which customers arebilled after the fact according to their phone use - in August,and in the hybrid plan known as ""control"" in the fourth quarter,he added. ""We're very optimistic about the country and the mobilebusiness in the second half of the year,"" Gebara told analystson a conference call to discuss second-quarter results, whichbeat market expectations despite a 55% slump in net profit. He said the company expects competitors to follow a morerational approach toward prices, especially in the pre-paidservice. Telefonica Brasil is also betting on handset sales tolift revenue in the coming months, according to Gebara. ""We have been working on our inventory and we expect tocompete with retailers,"" he added. In the fixed-line segment, the Brazilian subsidiary ofSpain's Telefonica sees average revenue per user (ARPU)growing as it improves the technology by expanding thefiber-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband service. ""We will be able to increase margins going forward as webring FTTH to as many cities as we can,"" Gebara said, noting thecompany might consider options to accelerate the process, suchas sharing infrastructure with other players.

"By Will Boggs MD NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Men with and without hypogonadism have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with testosterone therapy, according to a case-crossover study. ""While testosterone therapy can have great benefits for men, cardiovascular risk needs to be kept in mind and monitored for at least 6 months after a man's last prescription,"" said first author Rob F. Walker of the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, in Minneapolis. ""Not only VTE, but stroke and heart attack have been found to be associated with testosterone therapy, and giving a prescription to patients should be done after careful consideration and assessment,"" he said. The findings were published online November 11 in JAMA Internal Medicine. Baseline testosterone levels are not associated with an increased risk of VTE. But exogenous testosterone therapy can increase hematocrit levels, and the associated increase in blood viscosity might increase the risk of subsequent VTE events. Studies addressing this concern, however, have yielded conflicting results. Walker and colleagues investigated whether exposure to testosterone therapy is associated with an increased risk of incident VTE among more than 39,000 men, including 3,110 diagnosed with hypogonadism and 36,512 without hypogonadism. Men in the case periods (one, three and six months before the VTE events) were compared with themselves in the control periods (one, three and six months before the case period). Among men without hypogonadism, testosterone therapy was associated with 96% higher odds of VTE when using the one-month case period, 2.46-fold higher odds of VTE when using the three-month case period, and 2.02-fold higher odds of VTE when using the six-month case period, compared with the equivalent control periods. Similarly, among men with hypogonadism, testosterone therapy was associated with 66%, 2.28-fold and 2.32-fold increases in the odds of VTE, respectively. All risk increases were statistically significant. Among men without hypogonadism, the VTE risk in the three-month case period was higher for men younger than 65 than for older men, but this interaction was not statistically significant, and there was no similar interaction among men with hypogonadism. Associations between testosterone therapy and VTE risk did not differ by the route of testosterone therapy (transdermal or intramuscular). ""For men with hypogonadism, there is an inherent need for testosterone therapy,"" Walker said. ""A man with hypogonadism may require a more careful eye from clinicians regarding VTE risk, including other factors like weight, smoking status, race, etc."" ""For men without hypogonadism, however, they might be needlessly putting themselves at a higher risk for a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism with these therapies, especially younger men,"" he said. ""Other medications or even 'prescribed' lifestyle changes could be beneficial while carrying less of a risk for this group of men, but if testosterone therapy is deemed appropriate, I think clinicians may also want to carefully watch for VTE triggers, risk factors, and warning signs."" ""More research assessing risk for high-risk subgroups of men, such as risk by race, geography, or urban/rural divide, would help further inform clinicians about testosterone prescription decisions, and we hope to continue researching this very important topic,"" Walker added. Dr. Damon E. Houghton of Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota, who in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis (https://bit.ly/34XT0d4) found little evidence to support an association between testosterone therapy and VTE, told Reuters Health, ""This study pushes the discussion of testosterone and risk of VTE from whether it is a risk factor, to how much of a risk factor and what physiologically is driving this process. This study adds solid evidence that testosterone supplementation is a risk factor for VTE and that the highest risk occurs within the first several months after drug initiation."" ""The driving mechanism behind this association remains unclear,"" he said. ""A better understanding of why this is occurring and what groups would be at the highest risk may lead to more nuanced discussions of risk and possibly even ways to minimize risk if and when testosterone supplementation is truly necessary."" ""Risk of VTE with testosterone should now be a standard part of shared decision making discussions prior to testosterone supplementation,"" Dr. Houghton said. Dr. Charles J. Glueck of the Cholesterol, Metabolism, and Thrombosis Center, in Cincinnati, Ohio, who has reported a link between testosterone therapy, thrombophilia and VTE (https://bit.ly/2QmqOfV), told Reuters Health by email, ""We have very recently published that the greatest density of thromboembolic events was at 3 months after starting testosterone, with a rapid decline by 10 months. The data (in the new report) showed the exact same finding. Previous population studies which focused on thromboembolic events after 6-12 months probably missed the testosterone-thromboembolism relationship because of this time course."" ""Testosterone therapy should be given only to men with documented hypogonadism, with antecedent warning of thromboembolic risk, and optimally, with pre-testosterone therapy screening for thrombophilia,"" he said. ""Testosterone should not be given to patients with documented familial and acquired thrombophilia, particularly if they are heterozygous for the Factor V Leiden mutation and/or have the Lupus Anticoagulant,"" added Dr. Glueck, who like Dr. Houghton was not involved in the new study.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Austin-June 04: Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to Becton Dickinson Euro FinanceS.a.r.l.'s EUR2 billion unsecured notes.The notes were issued last month whenFitch assigned the notes an expected 'BBB-'(EXP) rating. Fitch hasnow finalizedthe rating. Proceeds of the notes are expected to be used to refinanceoutstanding debt. The ratings apply to $20.7 billion of debt at March 31, 2019. Key Rating Drivers Broadened Portfolio Post-Bard Acquisition: The C.R. Bard acquisition expandedBDX's product offerings in infection prevention and medication management. WhileBDX already had leading positions in these two areas, the addition of Bard'sportfolio enables BDX to supply healthcare providers with a more complete set oftherapeutic tools. The acquisition also gives BDX opportunities to drivehigh-growth platforms in vascular access and biosurgery, as well as a platformon which to build Bard's relatively early-phase expansion into internationalmarkets. Extended High Leverage: The 'BBB-' rating reflects Fitch's expectation that BDXwill follow a similar deleveraging process with the December 2017 Bardacquisition as it did after the purchase of CareFusion Corp. Fitch calculatestotal debt to EBITDA at March 31, 2019 was 4.0x. Assuming a relatively smoothintegration, the company should be able to generate enough cash flow within twoyears to reduce debt to below the 3.5x level that Fitch views as consistent withthe 'BBB-' rating. Based on Fitch's EBITDA forecast for the combined company,BDX will need to pay down roughly USD2.8 billion of debt by Dec. 31, 2019, whichis within the two years following the transaction to reduce leverage to roughly3.5x. The company is making good progress and debt has already been reduced byapproximately USD1.7 billion at March 31, 2019. Recent Acquisitive Posture: BDX increased its acquisitive posture with therecent acquisition of Bard and the 2015 acquisition of CareFusion. The evolvingdynamics of healthcare reimbursement, including the increasing need formanufacturers and innovators to demonstrate the value of their products tocommand market share and pricing growth, contributed to consolidation in themedical device industry. Prior to the recent large transactions, BDX washistorically only modestly acquisitive, evidenced by its cumulative execution ofroughly USD500 million of net cash acquisitions since fiscal 2000, excludingBard and CareFusion. Further Operational Improvement Expected: BDX improved operations during thepast four years, evidenced by top-line growth, moderately improving margins andincreasingly positive FCF. The successful integration of CareFusion bodes wellfor the prospects of integrating Bard and realizing the approximately USD300million of cost synergies targeted as part of the return profile of thetransaction. BDX appears to be on track in this regard to date for Bard'sintegration, with some of the more straightforward cost synergies having beenexecuted. Expected Strong FCF: Fitch expects normalized annual FCF to be greater than USD2billion. Moderately increasing organic revenue growth and margins should drivethe improved cash generation. The stepped-up FCF generation will be necessaryfor BDX to pay down sufficient debt to reduce leverage to below the 3.5x levelconsistent with the 'BBB-' rating. Both BDX and Bard, as stand-alone companies,were historically consistent generators of significant, positive FCF, whichaugurs well for future FCF generation. Offering Value to Providers: Many of BDX's products are on the right side of thevalue equation in health care. Reducing infection rates, improving medicationcompliance and increasing provider efficiency all contribute to improvingtreatment outcomes for patients. Improved outcomes and reduction in medicationloss, theft and shelf-life expiries also help reduce costs to providers. Thecompany develops products that offer a strong value proposition, which shouldsupport the firm's ability to continue negotiating favorable payment terms withcustomer. Derivation Summary Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX) is a broadly diversified company withleading market positions in the majority of product platforms and treatmentsegments in which it operates. The firm is in the top-tier of medical device,diagnostics and product firms in terms of size and scale. BDX is larger thanBaxter International Inc. (BAX, A-/Stable), and it is larger and morediversified than Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX, BBB/Stable). However, itsrecent acquisitive posture has resulted in significantly higher debt leveragethan BAX and BSX. A large portion of sales are generated by consumable and disposable products,reducing BDX's exposure to potential pricing headwinds that have historicallyaffected sales of larger and more expensive capital equipment and implantablemedical devices. Improving operations, a stable operating environment and anability to consistently generate meaningfully positive FCF support the company'scredit profile, while its recently increased acquisitive stance weighs on therating profile. The unsecured notes ratings at Becton, Dickinson and Company andBecton Dickinson Euro Finance S.a.r.l. are the same due to strong legal andoperational ties between the entities. Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S.a.r.l. isa finance company created to issue European debt and the bonds are guaranteed bythe parent entity BDX. Key Assumptions --Organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits; --EBITDA margin increases to 33% from 31%, with the achievement of costsynergies from the Bard acquisition; --Normalized annual FCF (CFO minus capex and dividends) of USD2.0billionؘ-USD2.5 billion; --Leverage to decrease below 3.5x by 2020 due to a combination of EBITDA growthand debt paydown; --Targeted acquisitions. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive RatingAction --BDX generates continued strong operating performance that producesconsistently positive and increasing FCF; --The integration of Bard and the related USD300 million of cost synergies arelargely achieved by 2020; --The company demonstrates the willingness, a rationale and an ability tomaintain gross debt/EBITDA durably below 3.0x and adjusted debt/EBITDAR durablybelow 3.3x, with acquisitions driving leverage above that for only relativelyshort periods of 12-24 months. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative RatingAction --BDX fails to generate stable operating performance, and FCF materially anddurably deteriorates; --The integration of Bard and the related USD300 million of cost synergies fallsubstantially short of expectations; --Gross debt/EBITDA fails to decline below 3.5x and adjusted debt/EBITDAR failsto decline below 3.8x within two years of the Bard acquisition; --The company pursues a more aggressive capital-deployment stance regardingacquisitions and/or share repurchases. Liquidity and Debt Structure Sufficient Liquidity: BDX presently has sufficient liquidity, including fullavailability on its USD2.25 billion revolving credit facility. Liquidity isbolstered by consistently strong cash generation and USD686 million in readilyavailable cash as of March 31, 2019. Fitch expects liquidity to remain strongthroughout the forecast period. FCF to Reduce Debt: BDX financed the Bard acquisition with a combination of termloan debt, unsecured bonds and equity. Leverage reduction has been aided byprepayable term loans and near-term bond maturities. Further reductio isexpected through repayment of USD1.1 billion notes due Dec. 2019. Fitch expectsBDX will direct most of the cash it generates toward debt repayment until itreaches total debt to EBITDA of 3.0x, at which point debt will likely berefinanced rather than retired. Summary of Financial Adjustments Historical and projected EBITDA is adjusted to add back non-cash stock basedcompensation and merger and integration expenses.

"(Adds details) JOHANNESBURG, Oct 2 (Reuters) - One of South Africa's largest mining unions filed a court case on Wednesday against privately-owned manganese and chrome producer Samancor Chrome relating to alleged fraud. Human rights lawyer Richard Spoor, who is representing the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) said the case related to fraud and profit shifting worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Samancor, the second largest chrome producer in the world, declined to comment immediately. ""The company is stealing from the workers,"" AMCU President Joseph Mathunjwa said on the sidelines of a mining conference in Johannesburg. AMCU has an interest in Samancor Ltd., through its members in the Ndizani Workers ESOP Trust which indirectly owns 5.6% of Samancor. The court papers allege the directors engaged in corrupt dealings and estimated these caused a loss to employees from the Ndizani Workers ESOP trust to the value of $100 million. The AMCU rose to prominence during labour unrest which led to the 2012 killing of striking mine workers at Lonmin's Marikana mine.

"(Adds details on regulatory changes, election outlook, financial metrics, context; adds information on Cyrela) By Gabriela Mello and Gram Slattery SAO PAULO, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Latin America's two largest homebuilders struck an optimistic tone on Friday, saying profits should increase in coming quarters as key regulatory issues have been solved and Brazil's presidential election should not disrupt housing subsidy programs. Speaking to analysts after the release of second-quarter results, Rafael Menin, co-chief executive of MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA, said dividends and cash generation would likely increase in the second half of the year. The danger of falling behind with construction approvals - a perennial problem in Brazilian real estate - is low, he added, as MRV has already secured 70 percent of the needed permits. Executives at Cyrela Brazil Realty SA, MRV's more upscale peer, also expressed optimism, saying they expected to improve margins in the second half of the year, with a second dividend payout likely in 2018. Both companies have been hamstrung recently by regulatory issues in the city of Sao Paulo, a key market of over 12 million people. Those issues have been largely resolved, however, which could mean a significant amount of  new home launches in the third and fourth quarters. Under the new regulations, Cyrela executives said, companies will be able to launch subsidized 'Minha Casa, Minha Vida' housing projects in Sao Paulo's often-desirable central areas, which Cyrela plans to do in order to meet increased competition. Executives at both companies played down the possibility of dramatic changes to the Minha Casa, Minha Vida program that could result from presidential elections this October, adding they were optimistic about recent regulatory changes allowing increased use of a fund known as FTGS to finance mortgages. Shares in Cyrela had fallen 3 percent in early afternoon trade after the firm missed profit estimates, while shares in MRV fell 1.8 percent after roughly meeting expectations. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index was off some 2.2 percent as a severe sell-off in the Turkish lira prompted an emerging markets shakeout.

"By Michael Taylor KUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Over the pastyear, the number of patients treated each day in the hospitalunit where cardiologist Ade Imasanti Sapardan works inIndonesia's capital has almost doubled to about 100. Sapardan, who sees up to 150 people every week, citesworsening air pollution as a major reason for the rise inpatients seeking treatment in the mega-city of Jakarta, home to10 million people. ""People in Jakarta have bad pollution every day . . .everybody is not really breathing safe air,"" Sapardan told theThomson Reuters Foundation. Half her patients suffer from symptoms linked to airpollution - like chest pains, coughing and breathlessness. Nine out of 10 people breathe polluted air, according to theWorld Health Organization (WHO), a problem that impacts morecities in Asia than anywhere else in the world. Burning fossil fuels is a large contributor to airpollution, which kills about 7 million people prematurely eachyear. Green campaigners and energy experts say Asia's growingdemand for coal-fired power is one key cause of that pollution. Coal demand outside Asia peaked in 1988 and has since fallenby a third. During the same period, it rose 3.5-fold in Asia, now theworld's main driver of coal-power demand, according to a reportpublished late last year by the Center for Strategic andInternational Studies (CSIS) in Washington. ""Cities with the worst air pollution are all in Asia and alot of it is to do with coal,"" said Nikos Tsafos, a CSISresearcher. ""The region has such huge economic growth and potential,where the desire to bring electricity to people trumps all otherconcerns."" An air quality report published by Greenpeace and IQAirAirVisual this month showed that the world's 100 most pollutedcities are largely in Asia - with India and China dominating. Jakarta and Hanoi are the two most polluted cities inSoutheast Asia, according to the report. But while China has already curbed coal use to meetpolitically important smog targets, and India this year launcheda nationwide anti-pollution program, Tsafos said Southeast Asiawas a ""blind spot."" LAWSUIT Like many Asian countries, Indonesia is experiencing a risein urbanization, population and economic growth and isscrambling to find ways to increase its power capacity. Jakarta has about 10 coal power plants within a 100-km(60-mile) radius of the city, green campaigners said, with up tothree more being planned. Now 20 Jakarta residents are to file a lawsuit againstIndonesian President Joko Widodo, backed by non-governmentalorganizations including environmental group Greenpeace. They argue policymakers have not done enough to tackle airpollution in the capital and hope to force the government tomove away from coal power and into renewables. Sapardan's medical expertise will be used in the action,which will also target the governors of Jakarta and itssurrounding regions as well as the country's health and forestryministers. They want a tightening of air standards, co-ordinatedefforts to tackle air pollution, and recognition by the centralgovernment of the link between coal-power plants and airpollution, to force a change in power policy. ""The global trend is now to stay away from coal, but inSoutheast Asia it has gone the other way, including inIndonesia,"" said Tata Mustasya, climate and energy campaigncoordinator at Greenpeace Southeast Asia. ""We still use coal and are expanding it to meet our powerneeds."" A spokesman for Widodo, who will stand for re-election innational polls next month, was unable to provide an immediatecomment, while the energy ministry did not respond to requestsfor comment. Asia-Pacific consumed 75 percent of the world's coal in2017, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, upfrom 50 percent 20 years ago. An abundance of locally produced, cheap coal and a failureto promote alternative energy sources were key reasons for Asiabucking the global trend away from coal, energy experts said. ""We have cases in the Philippines where people are sufferingrespiratory diseases because of coal-power plants and coal ashfrom which they will never recover,"" said Rayyan Hassan,executive director at the NGO Forum on ADB in Manila. CASH FLOW With many investment and development banks moving away fromcoal projects, financing Asia's coal boom has been left tostate-backed banks and bilateral agencies, energy experts andenvironmental campaigners said. Japan ramping up its coal-power capacity after the Fukushimanuclear disaster had led to a boon in clean-coal technologiesthat were now being exported across Asia, said green activists,who also cited China's Belt and Road Initiative. ""There is a narrative that says a lot of this is beingenabled by the Belt and Road Initiative - that China isexporting coal technology and generation to the region,"" saidTsafos. But as renewable energy becomes more competitive, marketforces will help move Asia away from coal, said Yongping Zhai,an energy expert at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Manila. The ADB's 2009 energy policy states that the bank can stillconsider coal projects in rare cases where the power providesenergy access to the poor and uses advanced technologies. Despite this, the ADB has no coal-power projects in thepipeline and the last coal-power project it was involved withwas back in 2013, said Zhai. Although the effects of air pollution in Asia would be feltfor decades, Tsafos said calls for clean air in China had led toa reduction in coal consumption and this could now be mirroredin other parts of Asia. ""Local air pollution can be a really good agent of change,""he said. ""That's where pressure can pop up really quicklybecause people can see the damage but also politicians can showthat they've delivered results.""",FEATURE-Asia's coal addiction puts chokehold on its air-polluted cities,"indonesia's growing demand for coal-fired power is one key cause of air pollution. burning fossil fuels is a large contributor to airpollution, which kills about 7 million people prematurely eachyear. 20 jakarta residents are to file a lawsuit againstindonesian president joko widodo. they argue policymakers have not done enough to tackle airpollution in the capital.",feature-indonesia's ' blind spot ' on air pollution : asia's coal-fired power boom fuels health crisis

"By Lenzy Krehbiel-Burton TULSA, Okla. (Reuters) - The Oklahoma Board of Education on Thursday approved a record number of emergency teacher certificates to fill a shortfall of qualified faculty that has not eased even as the state enacted its first major pay raise in a decade. With the school year already under way in most parts of the state, the board approved 916 emergency certificates to allow educators who are not fully accredited to teach, it said. With the new certificates, the total for the current fiscal year is at 2,153, a record high. Use of the certificates has grown quickly in recent years. In the 2011-12 year, it issued 32 emergency certificates, data showed. Oklahoma teachers walked off the job in April, seeking more money for schools devastated by years of education funding cuts and to bolster their salaries, which had ranked among the lowest in the nation. The strike was part of a wave by teachers in states with some of the lowest per-student spending in the country. To prevent school closings, the Republican-dominated Oklahoma legislature approved its first tax increase in more than two decades to provide an average pay raise of $6,100 for teachers, which went into effect this month. Joy Hofmeister, a Republican and state Department of Education superintendent, said the pay raise was a crucial step but more must be done to fix the teacher shortage. ""The challenges facing Oklahoma classrooms cannot be remedied by a one-year fix any more than one time on a treadmill makes you ready for the Olympics,"" she said in a social media post. Oklahoma teachers have been leaving the state for higher wages and even with the raise, salaries elsewhere remained higher in neighboring states. In May 2017, the annual mean wage for Oklahoma teachers was $41,880, among the lowest in the country, compared with neighbors Texas at $57,830 and Kansas at $50,470, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Republican Governor Mary Fallin, who leaves office in January due to term limits, said this week she considered the pay raise one of her biggest accomplishments. But teachers and administrators said it did little to alleviate large class sizes, repair decaying school infrastructure or replace dilapidated text books held together with duct tape. An Oklahoma State School Boards Association survey this month showed the state would start the school year with about 500 teaching vacancies, even with the record number of emergency certified educators.

"(Recasts, adds details) By Marine Pennetier BIARRITZ, France, Aug 23 (Reuters) - France and Britainaimed on Friday to present a united front on how to deal withIran, where they have been at odds with the United States, asworld powers prepare to discuss tensions on the issue during theG7 leaders' summit. European states have been scrambling to save a 2015 nucleardeal between world powers and Iran since U.S. President DonaldTrump pulled out of the accord last year and re-imposedsanctions on Tehran that have crippled its economy. Trump is due to meet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson onthe sidelines of the G7 in southwest France, as Britain's exitfrom the European Union nears and London's European allies watchto see how the Trump-Johnson dynamic plays out. They are also looking to see if there is any change ofcourse from Britain, notably on Iran. ""We are strong supporters of the JCPOA (Iran deal),"" said aBritish diplomatic source in Biarritz. ""We think that it is veryimportant that Iran doesn't get the nuclear weapons ... It isimportant that it continues and I don't think you will find anychange in the British government position."" The source said it was critical that Iran complies fullywith the accord, but that while Johnson would listen to the U.S.position there would not be a radical change in approach. ""If the U.S. president has other ideas on how we can achievethat (Iran not getting nuclear weapons), we are very happy totalk about it,"" the source said. European powers party to the deal - France, Britain andGermany, known as the E3 - have remained united despite pressurefrom Washington, with Paris leading efforts to defuse tensionsas Iran gradually reduces some of its commitments to the accord. ""Great Britain is sticking to its classic European choices... be it in climate, biodiversity, Iran or defence,"" said aFrench official in Biarritz. ""It's important to keep the E3together on Iran."" French President Emmanuel Macron met Iranian ForeignMinister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Friday in a closed-door sessionwith the aim of discussing proposals that could ease the crisis,including the idea of reducing some U.S. sanctions or providingIran with an economic compensation mechanism. Zarif said the talks had been productive. ""France presented some suggestions and we presented somesuggestions about how to carry out (the nuclear deal) and thesteps that both sides need to take,"" Zarif was quoted as sayingby ILNA news agency. ""Of course it depends on how the European Union can carryout the commitments within (the nuclear deal) and also thecommitments that they made after (the nuclear deal) andAmerica's exit,"" Zarif said.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong-May 24: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Hangzhou HikvisionDigital Technology Co., Ltd.'s (Hikvision) Long-Term Foreign-Currency andLocal-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and senior unsecuredforeign-currency rating at 'A-'. The Outlook is Stable. The affirmation reflects our expectations that the company will maintain itsstrong market position, technology leadership, and robust FCF margins at over 5%over the next two or three years, driven primarily by strong ongoing demand inthe domestic market. Revenue exposure to the US is relatively low - in thesingle-digit percentage of total revenue - and therefore we do not believe thatUS-imposed tariffs will have a material effect on the credit rating. There are recent press reports that the US administration is consideringblacklisting the company, which might prevent Hikvision sourcing chips, harddisk drives and other components from US companies. Hikvision still has torespond in full about this exposure, but has high ratings headroom to absorb theeffect of higher costs or slower growth whilst maintaining its ratings at thecurrent level. Nevertheless, trade tensions between the US and China have thepotential to affect cash flows beyond our current expectations, and our analysiswill be updated when developments warrant. KEY RATING DRIVERS Moderate Linkage with CETC: Fitch assesses the linkages between Hikvision andits stronger parent, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), tobe 'Moderate', and therefore we rate Hikvision a notch higher than itsstandalone credit profile of 'bbb+'. Hikvision is CETC group's only operator inthe surveillance market and general platform for key projects, such as ""SafeCity"" and ""Smart City"". It is CETC's most profitable subsidiary, contributing asignificant portion of CETC's operating profit and cash flow from operations(CFO) in 2018. CETC is wholly owned by the State-Owned Assets and AdministrationCommission of China's State Council. Market-Leading Position: Hikvision's ratings benefit from its market-leadingposition in the global market for closed-circuit television and videosurveillance equipment. Its global market share by revenue scale wassignificantly higher than the second-largest vendor, Zhejiang Dahua TechnologyCo., Ltd. Market share was roughly four times that of the third-largestprovider, Sweden's Axis Communications AB. Investing 7%-9% of revenue in research and development, Hikvision is able tomaintain one to two years of technology leadership over its rivals. Corecompetitiveness is tied up with a full-suite product offering and systemsolutions, integrated with expertise in artificial intelligence, big data, deeplearning and edge computing. Strong Cash Flow Generation: We believe that Hikvision's EBITDA margins and FCFmargins will remain strong over 2019-2022, at 25%-27% and 6%-8%, respectively.We expect the market position of its video surveillance products and technologyinnovation to continue to underpin its wide EBITDA margin and robust free cashflow (FCF) generation. Operating cash flow was more than four times the level ofcapex in 2018, and the FCF margin was a solid 6%. Low Leverage; Healthy Liquidity: We expect Hikvision to maintain itsconservative financial structure with FFO adjusted leverage below 1.0x during2019-2022. It had a net cash position of CNY19 billion at end-December 2018. Weexpect it to maintain healthy liquidity and leverage metrics in the next fewyears, driven by its expanding market share, high profitability and management'strack record of conservative financial policies. Steady Long-Term Industry Growth: Hikvision derives more than 70% of revenuefrom domestically, driven by its solid relationship with governments and largecorporates and technology leadership. We believe the long-term industry growthwill remain intact despite potential economic slowdown in the short term, giventhe strategic importance of public security to its key clients. We also expectit to benefit from the robust growth in countries such as India and Russia,which are relatively immune to US-China trade tensions and have relatively lowsurveillance penetration. DERIVATION SUMMARY Hikvision's 'A-' IDR benefits from its leading market position in the globalvideo surveillance market; its well-diversified customer portfolio; strongorganic cash flow generation; and a conservative financial structure. Its 'bbb+'standalone credit profile is stronger than that of Panasonic Corporation(bbb/Stable), ASE Technology Holding Co.,(ASE Holdco, bbb/Stable) and LGElectronics Inc. (LGE, bbb-/Stable) due to its leading market share, steadydemand growth and robust financial profile, notwithstanding its narrower productmix and less geographical diversification . KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer -   Solid revenue growth CAGR of 16% in 2018-2022, driven by stable globalsecurity expenditure and continued gains in market share -    Steady operating margin of 24%-25% in 2019-2022 -    Annual capex/revenue of around 4% -    Dividend pay-out ratio of around 50% in 2019-2022 RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive RatingAction -    Strengthening linkage with CETC -   Meaningful increase in video-surveillance market share while maintainingcredit metrics at their current level, or better Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative RatingAction -    Weakening linkage with CETC -    Significant deterioration in its video-surveillance market position -    Significant M&A that negatively affects operations or Hikvision's businessprofile -    Sustained FFO-adjusted leverage above 1.0x LIQUIDITY Robust Liquidity: Hikvision's readily available cash and net cash were CNY26billion and CNY19 billion, respectively, at end-2018. Its restricted cash ofCNY529 million was used primarily for guarantee of letters of credit foroperating purposes. We expect the company to maintain a large net cash positionin the medium term, driven by its steady organic cash flow generation due to anEBITDA margin wider than its peers. Total debt was CNY7 billion at end-2018. In February 2019, it refinanced itsEUR400 million of senior unsecured bonds through a euro-denominated syndicationloan, roughly the same amount as previous bonds. Renminbi-denominated loansaccounted for 54% of total debt, while foreign debt consisted mainly ofeuro-denominated bonds. Committed undrawn credit facilities were CNY14.7 billionat end-2018.

"By Mark Weinraub GLEN ULLIN, N.D., July 23 (Reuters) - Wheat yield potentialin south central North Dakota is trending above average, withthe crop benefiting from ideal weather following a wet springthat delayed planting, scouts on annual tour found on Tuesday. ""This is really good wheat for out here,"" said Dave Green,executive vice president of the Wheat Quality Council, whichruns the tour. ""I think everything looks good for being solate."" North Dakota is the biggest U.S. producer of springwheat,which is used to make artisanal breads, pizza dough andbagels. Spring wheat can also be blended with lesser grades ofwheat to improve flour quality. Spring wheat makes up about a quarter of total U.S. wheatproduction. Yields along one route of the Wheat Quality Council's annualtour of the state were pegged at 38.6 bushels per acre (bpa),based on the average of six fields surveyed in Stutsman, Mortonand Stark counties. A year ago, the tour projected yields on thesame route at 34.7 bpa. The five-year average is 33.8 bpa. On another route further east that went through Cass andBarnes counties, scouts calculated yield prospects of 50.0 bpa,up from 40.3 bpa a year ago and the five-year average of 48.0bpa. Some evidence of scab was noted, likely due to the overlywet conditions much of the crop was seeded in. A third route, which also pulled samples in Cass and Barnescounties, estimated the average yield from four fields at 71.0bpa, well above the 30.6 bpa average for the route last year andthe route's average of 42.7 bpa. MGEX spring wheat futures were up slightly atmidday on Tuesday, supported by technical buying and improvingdemand from Asian flour millers but capped by good yieldprospects for the U.S. spring crop. The U.S. Agriculture Department on Monday afternoon said theNorth Dakota spring wheat crop was rated 76 percent good toexcellent as of July 21, an above-average rating that wasunchanged from a week earlier and in line with marketexpectations.

"By Isla Binnie MADRID, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Teen activist Greta Thunberg turned a spotlight on the struggles of the world's indigenous peoples against climate change on Monday, appearing at a U.N. summit alongside other young campaigners furious at the West's failure to tackle the crisis. Indigenous communities from the United States to South America and Australia have mounted increasingly vocal campaigns against new fossil fuel projects in recent years, finding common cause with the young European activists inspired by Thunberg. Pursued by a media scrum ever since arriving at the two-week conference last week after crossing the Atlantic by catamaran, Thunberg stayed largely silent during her first official appearance at the summit, to allow a young Native American, a Ugandan, a Philippine and a Pacific islander to speak. ""Their rights are being violated across the world and they are also among the ones being hit the most and the quickest by the climate and environmental emergency,"" Thunberg said of indigenous communities. Indigenous activists argue that their communities contribute almost none of the fossil fuels emissions driving climate change, but bear the brunt of extreme weather and loss of wildlife. Rose Whipple, of the Santee Dakota, native to Minnesota in the United States, called for an approach based on tradition and technology. ""The climate crisis is a spiritual crisis for our entire world. Our solutions must weave science and spirituality and traditional ecological knowledge with technology,"" she said. The meeting to address the implementation of a 2015 pact struck in Paris to limit temperature rises to well below 2 degrees celsius was shifted to Madrid after riots over inequality broke out in Chile, which had been due to play host. ""While countries congratulate each other for their weak commitments the world is literally burning out,"" said Chilean activist Angela Valenzuela. The low-lying Marshall Islands became the first nation to comply with a requirement in the Paris Agreement to increase its planned emissions reductions in 2018, a move bigger emitters are under pressure to follow by 2020. Carlon Zackhras, representing the atoll nation, said rising sea levels threatened his home, which is only two metres above the waterline. ""We are having to deal with issues we did not create,"" he said.

"Nov 23 (Reuters) - Two teenagers stole a small plane in a rural area of eastern Utah on Thursday, flying it at low altitude over a highway and landing at a regional airport before being arrested, officials said. The teens, ages 14 and 15, took the single-engine, propeller aircraft from a private airstrip in the small town of Jensen in the northeastern corner of Utah, the Uintah County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. The theft of the plane follows an incident in August when an airline worker stole an empty Bombardier Q400 commercial turboprop from a Seattle airport and crashed the empty plane after flying for around an hour, raising concerns about the security of parked aircraft. In the latest incident, which involved a far smaller plane, the teens flew at low altitude over Highway 40 and were seen in the air above the area of Gusher, which is about 30 miles (50 km) west of where they took off, the Sheriff's Office said. The teens thought about continuing to fly west to a more populated area of Utah, but they decided to turn around and land the plane at the Vernal Regional Airport, about 15 miles (25 km) from where they took off, the sheriff's office said. The office described the plane as a ""light sport aircraft."" The teens were arrested near the airport and placed in a youth detention center in the area. The sheriff's office statement did not list charges against the teenagers and a representative for the office could not immediately be reached for comment. The teenagers, whose names were not released, are from the Wasatch Front, an area of Utah that includes the state capital Salt Lake City and other large cities, and they lived in a group home there. It was not immediately clear if they had any previous experience flying a plane. The teenagers had been staying with friends in Jensen before stealing the plane, the sheriff's office said.

"FRANKFURT, July 17 (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp's foundation, the company's largest shareholder, pledged to work with unions and management to appoint a successor to its chairman Ulrich Lehner. Thyssenkrupp has been gradually dismantling its complex submarines-to-elevators business and last month merged its European steel assets with those of rival Tata, further retreating from a core business. Shareholders are pushing for a radical overhaul, urging the Essen, Germany-based conglomerate to consider selling its elevators business and materials services division, which distributes non-ferrous metals, alloys and stainless steel. Major restructuring moves have been opposed by workers and Thyssenkrupp's management. The company employs 158,000 in businesses ranging from food packaging to naval vessels and industrial services. Below are stakeholders with the power to influence Thyssenkrupp's fate: ALFRIED KRUPP VON BOHLEN AND HALBACH FOUNDATION The foundation is Thyssenkrupp's biggest shareholder with a 21 percent stake. It has 11 members and is headed by Ursula Gather, rector of the University of Dortmund, who also sits on the Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board. The foundation is tasked with preserving the ""unity"" of Thyssenkrupp and uses proceeds from Thyssenkrupp's dividend payments to further good causes in science and education. The foundation was set up after former chief executive Berthold Beitz persuaded the last member of the Krupp family, Arndt von Bohlen, to put the family shareholding into a foundation tasked with promoting the common good. Critics say that the unity of the conglomerate has long been compromised with the sale of VDM Group, Steel Americas and the merger of European steel assets with Tata. The foundation on Tuesday reiterated it will work with labour representatives and the company's management to develop a long-term strategy for the conglomerate. German newspaper Handelsblatt reported at the weekend that Gather had held talks with the largest shareholder of Kone on a potential merger of the two companies' elevator businesses. The first conversations took place as early as two years ago but the idea was rebuffed by Hiesinger, who wanted to hold on to Thyssenkrupp's most profitable division, Handelsblatt reported. CEVIAN Swedish activist investor Cevian holds an 18 percent stake in Thyssenkrupp. Lars Foerberg, founding partner of Cevian Capital, on Tuesday said: ""All great and enduring companies renew themselves, taking advantage of their strengths while adapting to new challenges and opportunities. As a large and long-term owner of Thyssenkrupp, Cevian Capital looks forward to supporting the company in achieving these objectives for the benefit of all Thyssenkrupp stakeholders."" He had renewed his call for deeper restructuring efforts a day after Thyssen struck its steel deal with Tata. ""There is now an urgent need and opportunity to address the significant and persistent underperformance of the industrial businesses,"" he said on July 1, adding that Thyssenkrupp could be valued at the equivalent of 50 euros ($58.5) per share. WORKERS Unions hold half the seats on Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board and any deal depends on their support, which Thyssenkrupp has so far won through major concessions regarding job guarantees and a pledge not to close factories. Together with representatives from the Krupp foundation, they have the power to block major strategic moves. Wilhelm Segerath, head of the Thyssenkrupp works council and a senior official in the IG Metall industrial trade union, on Monday said he regretted the departure of Lehner but understood his move. ELLIOTT The U.S. activist investor has said it sees ""significant scope for operational improvement"" at Thyssenkrupp. Elliott has a stake of below 3 percent according to its latest filing. It declined to comment on Tuesday. CHAIRMAN ULRICH LEHNER Thyssenkrupp's chairman resigned late on Monday, with his departure effective at the end of the month. Lehner signalled that there had been a clash with not just activist shareholders, but also with the Krupp foundation. ""The confidence of the major shareholders and a joint understanding within the Supervisory Board on the strategic direction of Thyssenkrupp were the basis for my work and a pre-requisite for my promise to Berthold Beitz to successfully further develop the company in the interest of customers, employees and shareholders. This is now no longer given,"" Lehner said in a statement late on Monday. ""I take this step consciously to enable a fundamental discussion with our shareholders on the future of Thyssenkrupp. My decision may contribute to creating the necessary awareness with all concerned parties that a break-up of the company and the related loss of many jobs is not an option – neither in the interest of the founder, nor in the interest of the country."" Lehner's remarks echoed a similar statement from former Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger on July 5, when he resigned, saying a ""joint understanding of board and supervisory board on the strategic direction of a company is a key pre-requisite for successfully leading a company"".

"    * U.S. weather outlook to aid corn development    * Soybeans firm despite fears of extended weak Chinesedemand    * Wheat edges higher despite ample global supplies    By Colin Packham    SYDNEY, Aug 7 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures edged higher onWednesday, though concerns forecasts for crop-friendly weatherand fears of a protracted U.S.-China trade war limited gains.    Soybeans firmed, despite fears of prolonged weak Chinesedemand for U.S. supplies, while wheat also shrugged off ampleglobal supplies to edge higher.    The most active corn futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up 0.2% at $4.13-1/2 a bushel, having closed down0.5% in the previous session.    Analysts said the weather outlook was weighing on marketsentiment.    ""Some U.S. corn regions are returning to a drier weatherpattern over the next week or so,"" said Tobin Gorey, director ofagricultural strategy, Commonwealth Bank of Australia.    The weather will allow fields to dry after recent heavyrains, analysts said, before expected rains arrive afterwards.    More rain is expected in the 11- to 15-day forecast, withnear-normal temperatures over the next two weeks, CommodityWeather Group said on Tuesday.    Fears over the outlook for global economy also draggeddespite the efforts of U.S. President Donald Trump to soothemarket nerves.    Trump dismissed concerns over a protracted trade war withChina, despite a warning by Beijing of financial market chaos.    The U.S. Department of Agriculture pegged 57% of U.S. corncrop in good-to-excellent condition, down 1 percentage pointfrom a week earlier.    The most active soybean futures were up 0.2% at$8.67-1/2 a bushel, having closed down 0.3% on Tuesday.    The USDA left its soybean conditions unchanged at 54%.    The most active wheat futures were up 0.3% at$4.85-1/2 a bushel, having closed down 2% on Tuesday.    Abundant global supplies of wheat remained an obstacle forU.S. export sales prospects.

"DUBLIN, March 18 (Reuters) - An Irish golf course and hotel owned by U.S. President Donald Trump has been refused planning permission to build a sea wall to protect the course from coastal erosion. In a decision published on Wednesday, Ireland's planning appeals board, Bord Pleanala, said it was not satisfied that the proposed development at Doonbeg in the western county of Clare would not adversely affect the sand dune habitat at the site. Trump's company wanted to build a 2.8 km armourstone wall up to 20 metres wide and 5 metres above the water line between the sea and the dunes. The golf club's management revised its plans in December 2016 after a campaign by environmental groups and locals, submitting a request for two less visible barriers around 625 metres and 250 metres in length, above the water line at either end of the beach. Permission was granted by the local county council for the revised plans in October 2017, but that has now been overturned by the planning appeals board. The Trump Organisation employs about 300 people at the resort -- where the president stayed during an official visit to Ireland last year -- and is one of the biggest employers in west county Clare. A planned 40 million euro development comprising a new ballroom, leisure facilities and 53 more holiday homes was on hold pending the board's ruling.

"By By Rik Sharma MADRID, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Champions Barcelona moved threepoints clear at the top of La Liga from Sevilla and AtleticoMadrid after thrashing Levante 5-0 on Sunday, while Real Madridscraped to a 1-0 win over Rayo Vallecano on Saturday. Here are five talking points from the weekend's action. IT'S EASIER WITH MESSI Barcelona suffered their only league defeat of last seasonat Levante in their penultimate game, spoiling their bid to gounbeaten. This time, it was a wholly different story. Why?Lionel Messi wasn't rested. La Liga's top scorer hit a hat-trick and set up the othertwo in Barcelona's thumping victory, becoming the only player inthe top five European leagues this season to reach doublefigures for both goals (14) and assists (10). Helping Barca go three points clear at the top, Messi andLuis Suarez have 25 league goals this season between them, onemore than Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid have managed in total.In fact, only Sevilla (29) and Celta Vigo (28) have outscoredthem in La Liga. SEVILLA ARE THE REAL DEAL After Barcelona swept to a 4-2 victory over Sevilla inOctober, many wondered if the Andalusians' title charge was overbefore it had begun. However, Pablo Machin's side have bounced back to go sevenleague games unbeaten since then, with the latest an impressive2-0 victory over Girona on Sunday which sees them sit second. Pablo Sarabia was on target again and his superb form is oneof the reasons Sevilla have been so dangerous this season. The midfielder has six goals and six assists in La Liga and,given that Spain coach Luis Enrique has shown he is willing tohand out chances to those who deserve it, the smart money is onSarabia earning his first international call-up in 2019. COURTOIS KEEPING MADRID ALIVE Just five points behind leaders Barcelona, Real Madrid arestill in the title race but despite an excellent record of fivewins from six games under Santiago Solari, their performancesstill leave much to be desired. Thibaut Courtois made an outstanding double save in stoppagetime to ensure they edged past Vallecano as he kept a sixthclean sheet in nine games under Solari in all competitions. Spanish newspaper AS published an article listing theBelgian's heroics against Huesca, Celta Vigo and Valladolid thatalso saved the team points. ESPANYOL NOSE DIVE Unlike Sevilla, Espanyol started the season well but havefallen dramatically off the pace and dropped from second inOctober down to 11th. Rubi's side have played some sparkling football and been farmore entertaining than under Quique Sanchez Flores, who wassacked in April after going five games without a goal. Yet Sunday's 3-1 home defeat by Real Betis was their fifthstraight league loss. After winning their first five leaguegames at home and turning their Cornella stadium into afortress, they now seem vulnerable there, conceding 10 in theirlast three games. However Rubi insists: ""I'm convinced that we will come outof this, we have played well and we will play well again."" GRIEZMANN READY FOR A REST Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann's double helpedhis side to a 3-2 win at Real Valladolid on his 300th La Ligaappearance, keeping Atletico third and in the title race. However, despite 10 goals in 23 games across allcompetitions, Griezmann said that he was still feeling theweight of an intense year which saw him win the Europa Leaguewith Atletico and the World Cup with France. ""I can still improve, I am not at my best level, it has beena long year and sometimes I lack speed,"" said Griezmann. ""I'm very happy to be able to help the team. It's a verylong year, we have a game and then a little rest."" With the winter break arriving after next weekend's clashwith Espanyol, Griezmann may finally be able to recharge hisbatteries.(Reporting by Rik SharmaEditing by Ian Chadband)",Soccer-Five talking points from the weekend in La Liga,barcelona thrash levante 5-0 to go three points clear at the top of la liga. lionel messi hits hat-trick and set up the othertwo in barcelona's thumping victory. sevilla have bounced back to go seven league games unbeaten since then. thibaut courtois made an outstanding double save in stoppagetime to ensure they edged past vallecano. antoine griezmann's double helpedhis side to a 3-2 win at real valladolid on his 300th la ligaappearance.,soccer-five talking points from the weekend in la liga
"By Dena Aubin (Reuters) - TV personality Montel Williams and a payday loan website he endorsed do not have to face racketeering charges for allegedly marketing illegal payday loans, a federal judge in California ruled on Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White in Oakland granted a judgment in favor of Williams and online firm MoneyMutual, saying borrowers suing them failed to show that they participated in coordinated activity to commit fraud, as required for claims under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The defendants, however, must face claims that they violated the California Deferred Deposit Transaction Law (CDDTL), which bars the origination of payday loans without a license, White ruled. The defendants had argued they did not know lenders on the MoneyMutual site were unlicensed, but knowledge of misconduct is not required under that law, White said. Montel Williams spokesman Jonathan Franks declined to comment. Lawyers for MoneyMutual did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jeffrey Wilens, a lawyer for the borrowers, said he is disappointed by the RICO claim dismissal, but remedies under the California payday loan law are essentially identical. ""We have already obtained an expert report placing defendants' financial exposure at more than $45 million, with the possibility of some of that being trebled,"" he said. The decision came in a 2013 lawsuit on behalf of hundreds of thousands of California borrowers who took out loans on MoneyMutual, a website that matches borrowers with lenders. The borrowers claimed they were lured to take out loans on MoneyMutual by endorsements from Williams, who promoted the site in radio, television and Internet advertising. In reality, lenders found on the site were offshore companies charging illegally high rates, the lawsuit said. Borrowers alleged that defendants violated RICO by using the U.S. mail, Internet and interstate telephone networks to aid unlicensed payday lenders, who collected illegally high interest rates. RICO bars the collection of unlawful debt. The lawsuit also said defendants violated the CDDTL by assisting the unlicensed lenders in the origination of payday loans. In a motion for summary judgment filed last year, MoneyMutual and Williams said there was no basis for a racketeering claim. The facts showed that they had nothing more than commercial relationships, such as operating a website for loans and serving as a celebrity endorser for it, those types relationships cannot establish liability under RICO, the defendants said. The defendants said they had no involvement in borrowers' loan agreements, terms of the loans or their collection. They said CDDTL claims fail because they require substantial assistance of illegal lending and actual knowledge of the illegal conduct, and neither were proved. The defendants said they were never told about the licensing status of the lenders or any illegal conduct by them. They also said the website had no duty under California law to investigate the lenders and their legal compliance. White agreed that the plaintiffs failed to show that the defendants knew the lenders were issuing illegal loans, as required for RICO claims. Violation of the CDDTL, however, does not require knowledge of the underlying misconduct, and defendants thus were not entitled to judgment on that claim, he said. The case is: Gilbert v. MoneyMutual, U.S. District Court, California Northern District, No. 13-cv-1171.

"* IEA lowers demand growth forecasts for 2019, 2020 * Supply curbs by OPEC and allies help support market * Concerns over U.S.-China trade war cap gains * Saudi to keep exports below 7 mln bbls in Aug, Sept-official(Adds Russia's comments) By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin LONDON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday,supported by expectations of more OPEC production cuts despitethe International Energy Agency (IEA) reporting demand growth atits lowest level since the financial crisis of 2008. Brent crude futures were up 89 cents at $58.27 abarrel by 1057 GMT. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futureswere at $53.33 per barrel, up 79 cents. ""Despite a further cut in oil demand growth by the IEA, oilprices are trading marginally higher, as the demand growth cutwas already announced previously by the head of the IEA and theagency still expects larger inventory draws for 2H19,"" UBSanalyst Giovanni Staunovo said. The IEA said global oil demand in the first half of 2019grew at its slowest pace since 2008 hurt by mounting signs of aneconomic slowdown and a ramping up of the U.S.-China trade war. Oil prices have lost more than 20% from peaks reached inApril, putting them in bear territory. Rystad Energy said the oil market was going ""from gloomy togloomier"", calling into question the consultancy's own bullishview for the first part of 2020. ""Economic recession risk and further escalation of theU.S.-China trade war are key concerns in the near term. How longOPEC+ is willing to continue to manage production addsuncertainty,"" said Bjørnar Tonhaugen, head of oil marketanalysis at Rystad Energy. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,Russia and other producers, an alliance known as OPEC+, agreedin July to extend their supply cuts until March 2020 to boostoil prices. Russia's energy ministry said IEA's estimates were largelyin line with its own forecasts and that Moscow had taken intoaccount the possibility of a slowdown in oil demand when itextended an output cut deal with OPEC. ""Market focus in oil has clearly shifted. It is squarely onfuture demand, rather than on supply,"" said HarryTchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP Paribas in London. Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the OPEC, plans to maintainits crude oil exports below 7 million barrels per day in Augustand September to bring the market back to balance and helpabsorb global oil inventories, a Saudi oil official said onWednesday.

"By Moushumi Basu ICHAPUR, India, March 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Asclimate change brought less predictable weather, farmersDeepankar Mandal and Sanjib Mandal used to struggle with growinguncertainty about whether they would get a crop each season. ""Rains have become erratic, insufficient or wrongly timed,""said Deepankar. ""The crops failed, the water table got lowereach year (and) there were newer pests attacking our paddy andvegetables."" Most years, ""we were battling against the odds for oursurvival"", added the farmer from India's West Bengal state. But in recent years, they have tried a new way to cope:producing biogas from cow manure to provide clean energy athome, and then using the leftover slurry to improve the soil intheir fields. The change has helped them save money by cutting out costlychemical fertilisers. It has also reduced deforestation andallowed them to restore the earth so it now holds more water,helping them through droughts, the farmers said. Moreover, with biogas to cook at home, ""we do not have towander for hours here and there in search of firewood fromnearby forests”, said Chobi Mandal, Deepankar's mother. These benefits are the result of a three-year push bySusanta Mukherjee, an agricultural scientist who works with theIndian government's Agricultural Technology Management Agency(ATMA), to help farmers in the village adopt organic farming asa way of coping with more challenging climate conditions. The new approach has also helped them reduce their alreadylow planet-warming emissions, he said. In Ichapur, 50 farmers, working on 20 acres (8 hectares) ofland, are now using the organic farming system, with another 40planning to join by mid-year. Under the effort backed by ATMA, farmers are each given acow and support to set up a home biogas production system. After water and manure are fed into a digestion tank, themethane produced is captured for use as cooking gas. Chobi Mandal said the gas was sufficient for her to cookthree meals a day - and meant she no longer had to work in smokyconditions over firewood. The leftover slurry from biogas production, rich in organicnutrients, is dried and used as fertiliser in the fields. Farmers also have been trained to use earthworms to helpproduce compost, and to concoct other natural fertilisers andorganic pesticides at home. LESS RAIN, LESS WATERING Deepankar Mandal said he could now go nearly two weekswithout watering his fields, even in dry periods, as the soilholds more moisture. Even on irrigated land, more water is retained and slowlyseeps into underground aquifers, helping recharge wells andother water bodies, said Mukherjee. Farmers are able to produce more crops, more consistently -all without chemical fertilisers and pesticides or big demand onlimited groundwater supplies, he said. Sanjib Mandal, who is unrelated to Deepankar, said riceproduction had risen 30-40 percent each year on average sincethe switch, while costs had fallen by about 35 percent. Besides harvesting two rice crops a year, farmers aregrowing vegetables and cattle feed, as well as crops like oats,sorghum and maize, and getting milk from their cows, he said. They have also noticed that their plants' roots seem to holdthe soil better, making them more able to withstand harsherstorms and strong winds, Mukherjee said. Persuading farmers to switch away from chemical fertilisersand pesticides wasn't easy at the start, Sanjib said. “There is a misconception prevailing among the conventionalfarmers that organic farming produces lower yields than thechemically grown crops,"" he said. The project, however, has ""demonstrated to them thecost-effectiveness and higher yield of crops in our fields"" -and that has led some other farmers to ""join our brigade"", hesaid. Finding funding to build home biogas plants - which costabout 30,000 rupees ($430) to set up - has been anotherchallenge for poorer farmers who cannot afford one on their own,said Biswajit Das, a farmer from Ichapur. The farmers' collective is seeking additional funding fromATMA to pay for more plants, he said. Meanwhile, farmers said they enjoyed seeing more life intheir now-organic fields, from owls and sparrows to honey beesand butterflies. They ""make our fields come alive"", said Srimanta Mandal, anIchapur farmer.(Reporting by Moushumi Basu; editing by Laurie Goering.

"(Repeats story published Tuesday with no changes) By Jennifer Ablan and Trevor Hunnicutt March 12 (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, the chief executiveof DoubleLine Capital and Wall Street's Bond King, called theincreasingly popular Modern Monetary Theory backed byprogressives a ""crackpot"" idea. Gundlach, who oversees more than $123 billion, said on aninvestor webcast on Tuesday that Modern Monetary Theory is""complete nonsense, yet it is being used to justify a massivesocialist program."" Modern monetary theorists argue government spending, anddeficits as needed, should be used to meet the full employmentand inflation mandates currently tasked to the U.S. FederalReserve. Taxes may not be needed to support all spending sincethe government can create more money and inflation is the mainrestraint on government spending, according to the theory. The ideas have gained currency with some economists andDemocratic Party politicians but have also been met with fiercecriticism. A leading proponent of Modern Monetary Theory, StateUniversity of New York at Stony Brook economics professorStephanie Kelton, advised democratic socialist U.S. SenatorBernie Sanders in his 2016 run for the Democratic presidentialnomination, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has alsoexpressed openness to the idea. ""What happens when the economy turns down?"" he asked.Gundlach added that the ""ridiculous"" MMT is a way of monetizingdebt and could lead to a significant boycott of long-term bonds.The ideas could gain popularity if the United States enters arecession in 2020, ahead of the next presidential election. Populist discontent has struck a nerve with some voters inthe United States, with liberals calling for higher taxes on therich and more spending to promote economic equality. Gundlach said the timing of a college bribery scandalreinforces that populist narrative. Federal authorities arrested dozens on Tuesday for a $25million scheme to help wealthy Americans, including actressesFelicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin and some finance executives,cheat their children's way into elite universities, such as Yaleand Stanford. Gundlach said: ""It really doesn't do all of us in the worldof finance a lot of reputational good...look at these people,turning the table in their favor. It's really prettyhorrifying."" Gundlach said the college bribery scandal ""really helps theElizabeth Warren crowd."" Warren vowed on Friday to break up Amazon.com Inc,Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc ifelected U.S. president to promote competition in the technologysector. Addressing the run-up in the U.S. stock market, Gundlachsaid he still thinks stocks are in a bear market. ""The stockmarket was and is in a bear market,"" he said, adding stockscould go negative again this year. Gundlach said the market rebound stemmed from the""remarkable 180-degree turn"" from the Federal Reserve, which isstraying away from quantitative tightening. He said the Fed willlikely keep $3.5 trillion in assets on its balance sheet. ""Maybethey realize that there really isn't anybody to buy all thebonds that appear to be potentially in prospect other than thecentral bank,"" Gundlach said.(Reporting by Jennifer Ablan and Trevor HunnicuttEditing by Phil Berlowitz and Lisa Shumaker)",RPT-DoubleLine's Jeffrey Gundlach calls Modern Monetary Theory a 'crackpot' idea," jeffrey gundlach, the chief executiveof doubleline capital and wall street's bond king, called modern monetary theory a "" crackpot "" idea. modern monetary theorists argue government spending should be used to meet the full employmentand inflation mandates currently tasked to the u.s . federalreserve.",rpt-update 1-doubleline's gundlach calls modern monetary theory a ' crackpot ' idea

"* Roads in Kashmir sealed off, impacting millions * Emergency orders prohibiting gatherings in several other areas in India * Indian rupee nears record low, Pakistan stocks at 5-year low By Fayaz Bukhari and Alasdair Pal SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI, March 19 (Reuters) - India blocked roads in Kashmir on Thursday after the insurgency-torn region reported its first case of coronavirus, as several other parts of the country imposed restrictions on public gatherings in attempts to prevent its spread. Densely-populated South Asia has been slow to be hit by coronavirus compared to elsewhere in the world. But new cases in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka are all accelerating, with the total across the region topping 500. Five people have died of the disease in the region. Authorities worry that these countries could be especially at risk should the virus begin to spread locally, due to poor health facilites and infrastructure. In Kashmir, dozens of people told Reuters they had been prevented from leaving their neighbourhoods on Thursday because roads were blocked by police and paramilitary units. Srinagar's senior superintendent of police Haseeb Mughal told Reuters that road blockades across the valley had been imposed to prevent the spread of the virus. ""I had to go to take my mother to hospital in Srinagar but the police has closed the road,"" said Mohammed Ayub, from the nearby town of Budgam. ""I am waiting here for the last two hours. I can't even go home now as the road is blocked due to a traffic jam."" Muslim-majority Kashmir, also claimed by India's arch-rival Pakistan, has been relatively unaffected by the virus, reporting its first case on Wednesday evening. But the picturesque valley of seven million is one of most militarised places on earth due a decades-long insurgency against Indian rule, and its residents have been subject to prolonged curbs on freedom of movement. An internet shutdown that began in August following sweeping constitutional changes in Kashmir has only just been eased. Several other areas in India have introduced curbs on public assembly as coronavirus cases in the country rose to 166. Late on Wednesday, the desert state of Rajasthan invoked colonial-era laws that prevent the unlawful assembly of 4 or more people - powers more often used to quell riots. Similar restrictions were also introduced in Noida, a satellite city of New Delhi. India's financial hub of Mumbai expanded its partial shutdown of offices to government buildings on Thursday, with at least half the staff ordered to work from home. The spread of the virus continued to hit markets across the region. The Indian rupee fell to a near-record low against the dollar, with Pakistan stocks hitting their lowest level in five years. Since emerging late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like coronavirus has infected over 218,000 people and killed nearly 9,000.

"By Jill Serjeant Jan 13 (Reuters) - Brad Pitt scored an Oscar nomination on Monday for his performance as a charming stuntman in ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" cementing his return to the forefront of show business. Pitt, 56, has never won an acting Oscar despite 30 years in the movie industry and three previous nominations. But he is considered the favorite to win the best supporting actor Academy Award next month, according to awards pundits, after wowing critics in Quentin Tarantino's love letter to Hollywood last summer. Pitt's performance as the laid-back stunt double and fixit man Cliff Booth to Leonardo DiCaprio's fading 1960s TV Western star has already won him a Golden Globe prize and a Screen Actors Guild nomination. It was lauded as a career best turn by the Hollywood Reporter, while Britain's Sunday Times said last year that the ""well-matured Pitt steals the show."" An extended shirtless scene sent fans and celebrity media swooning, ending a long period when Pitt was portrayed as the bad guy in the breakup of his marriages to both Angelina Jolie and first wife Jennifer Aniston, one of America's most popular celebrities. Pitt, not seen on the big screen since 2016 war drama flops ""Allied"" and ""War Machine,"" followed up ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" with a second well-received performance in space drama ""Ad Astra"" in 2019 where he played an introspective astronaut. ""I Think It’s Finally Acceptable to Be Completely and Totally Obsessed With Brad Pitt,"" ran a headline on women's website Cosmopolitan.com after Pitt returned to the red carpet last year. Pitt had adopted a low profile since 2016 as he and Jolie spent more than two years in a bitter custody dispute over their six children that involved accusations against the actor of child abuse, heavy drinking and drug use. In a 2017 interview, Pitt admitted a heavy marijuana habit and said his drinking had gotten out of control, but said that since the split with Jolie he had quit alcohol and was undergoing therapy. Pitt was cleared by investigators in Los Angeles of abuse allegations, which stemmed from an angry altercation in front of his children toward the end of his marriage to Jolie. ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" got a total of 10 Oscar nominations on Monday, including best picture, director and best actor for Pitt's co-star DiCaprio. The Oscars ceremony will take place in Hollywood on Feb. 9.

"WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said late on Tuesday it will make two new software updates to the grounded 737 MAX's flight control computer as it works to win regulatory approval to resume flights after it was grounded following two fatal crashes in five months. The planemaker said one issue involves hypothetical faults in the flight control computer microprocessor, which could potentially lead to a runaway stabilizer, while the other issue could potentially lead to disengagement of the autopilot feature during final approach. Boeing said the software updates will address both issues.

"WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The firing of tear gas canisters by U.S. border agents toward migrants in Mexico near a border crossing last month followed regulations, a senior Trump administration official said in testimony to Congress on Tuesday. On Nov. 25, U.S. border agents fired tear gas to disperse a group of migrants near the U.S.-Mexico border crossing separating Tijuana from San Diego when some rushed through fencing into the United States. A day after the incident, Mexico's foreign ministry presented a diplomatic note to the U.S. government calling for ""a full investigation"" into what it described as non-lethal weapons directed toward Mexican territory. Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees U.S. Border Patrol, said in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the use of tear gas was within the agency's regulations and came as agents faced a ""difficult situation."" The migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border ""were assaultive in their behavior, they threw rocks at agents,"" McAleenan said, adding that one agent had to have surgery as a result of injuries. McAleenan had earlier said in a statement that four agents were hit with rocks, but that they did not suffer serious injuries. Women and small children were within the group of migrants exposed to the tear gas, and images of them fleeing the approaching gas sparked outrage. McAleenan said women and children were ""absolutely not"" deliberately targeted by agents firing tear gas canisters. CBP is conducting an internal ""use of force"" review of the incident, McAleenan said. Large groups of mostly Central American migrants have sought this year to cross into the United States, and the Trump administration has made efforts to block their entry, including by sending thousands of U.S. troops to the southern border.

"SYDNEY, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Australia's sports federations have postponed youth matches in New South Wales as firefighters battled to contain nearly 150 fires burning in the eastern state on Friday that have blanketed Sydney, the nation's biggest city, in hazardous smoke. New South Wales Rugby League called off four junior representative trial matches scheduled over the weekend due to concerns over air quality resulting from the bushfires. ""The NSWRL has also recommended all clubs refrain from training outdoors until the air quality index has reduced to a safe level,"" the governing body said in a statement on Friday. Australia's soccer association postponed a junior league match scheduled for Saturday in the Central Coast region between the Mariners and the Newcastle Jets due to poor air quality forecasts. Matches in the top flight A-League and women's W-League in affected areas might also be cancelled if conditions deteriorate, Football Federation Australia said in a media release. Bushfires in Australia have killed at least four people and destroyed more than 680 homes since the start of November. Fires are still burning in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland states. Winds have blown thick smoke over Sydney, the state capital where about 5 million live. Players at the Australian Open golf tournament complained of stinging eyes after their rounds at course in Sydney.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-New York-June 25: Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating toFideicomiso Fibra Uno's (FUNO) proposed senior notes issuance. The final amountand tenor of the proposed senior notes issuance will depend on marketconditions. Proceeds from the proposed issuance will be used for generalcorporate purposes, which may include primarily debt substitution extending thecompany's debt maturity profile from 8.7 years (as of March 31, 2019) to around10 to 12 years (pro forma), as well as funding working capital and capexrequirements. Fitch currently rates Fibra UNO's Long-Term Foreign and LocalCurrency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Acomplete list of ratings follows at the end of this press release. The ratings reflect FUNO's solid market position as the leading and largestFibra (REIT) in Mexico. The ratings also consider the company's large,well-diversified portfolio of retail, industrial and office properties, strongfranchise value, diversified tenant base, high occupancy rates, credit metricsaligned with the rating level, and adequate financial flexibility in the form ofgood access to debt and equity markets, in conjunction with unsecured committedcredit lines, and an important unencumbered asset pool. FUNO's ratings arelimited by its current and projected leverage levels. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that the company will execute onits growth strategy through acquisitions and its own developments whilestabilizing its net leverage (net debt/EBITDA ratio) around 5.5x and reaching aninterest coverage ratio around 2.3x during 2020-2021. Fitch expects the companyto keep a significant pool of unencumbered assets at approximately USD10billion. The Stable Outlook also reflects FUNO's commitment to maintaining solidlevels of unused committed credit lines (current availability is around USD775million) as an additional source of liquidity. KEY RATING DRIVERS Largest Portfolio in Latin America: The ratings positively factor in FUNO'sscale and diversification. As the largest and most diversified real estateoperator in Latin America, FUNO has a consistent cash flow and has minimized itsrisk to various sectors, regions or tenants. As of March 31, 2019, FUNO's realestate portfolio contained 559 operating units  consisting of 347 commercialinvestments, 116 industrial sites and 96 offices with 8.7 million square metersof GLA and a consolidated occupancy rate of 95.4%. The total GLA breakdown was39% retail, 47% industrial and 14% office, located throughout 30 states in thecountry and Mexico City. FUNO's top 10 assets represent less than 20% of its netoperating income (NOI). The company reached total revenues of USD915 millionduring the LTM ended March 31, 2019. Growth Strategy and Management Expertise Incorporated: The ratings factor inFUNO's growth strategy, which has been primarily driven by acquisitions sinceits inception. The company's portfolio expansion has been funded with balancedcombinations of equity and debt. Fitch expects FUNO's GLA could increase by YE20to more than 9.0 million sqm through acquisitions and outstanding developmentprojects. The company's annualized income breakdown by segments was composed of49.4% retail, 24.6% industrial and 26% office as of March 31, 2019. The ratingsfactor in the controlling shareholders' and advisors' (control group) trackrecord in the Mexican real estate sector with more than 30 years of experiencein the acquisition, development, rental and operation of various types of realestate projects in Mexico. Diversified Tenants Base: FUNO maintains a low credit risk and diversifiedtenant base. Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V., under all of its store formats,is the most important tenant for FUNO, representing approximately 8.1% of annualbase rent (ABR) and 11.7% of total GLA. The top 10 tenants collectively accountfor approximately 25% of FUNO's ABR as of March 31, 2019. Fitch estimates morethan 70% of the company' revenue is generated from tenants that individuallycontribute less than 1.0% of annual revenue. The properties in operation aregeographically diversified in all states with approximately 3,500 tenantsdistributed through various industries and sectors. This diversification helpsprotect the company's cash flows from economic weakness in any particular regionand credit risk at the tenant level. High Occupancy: The company's strategy is focused on maintaining competitiverent prices per sqm in order to support occupancy and renewals along economiccycles. This strategy allows FUNO to have high occupancy levels. Fitch estimatesthe average monthly rent per sqm in 2019-2020 for each segment could reachlevels around MXN240/sqm in retail, MXN85/sqm in industrial and MXN310/sqm inoffice. Fitch estimates the company's 2019-2020 occupancy rate for the retail,industrial and office segments will be around 95%, 97% and 89%, respectively.Fitch expects occupancy rates for the total portfolio to be around 95% during2019-2020. Low Rental-Income Risk: The ratings factor in the company's low rental incomerisk profile, which is reflected in the company capacity to sustain high andstable EBITDA margin levels. Fitch expects the company's EBITDA margin to remainstable around 75% during 2019-2020. FUNO's portfolio characteristics includehigh occupancy, average lease duration in the four to six year range, and mostof its leases renewed flat to positive with renewal rates consistently above85%. FUNO's lease contracts characteristics contain annual inflation adjustmentsand currency denomination. The company's ratings also factor in well-ladderedlease maturities with no more than 15% of GLA expiring in any given year. Capex Plan Incorporated: The ratings incorporate Fitch's expectation the companywill maintain a stable capital structure while executing its projects underdevelopments. FUNO's portfolio has seven properties in various stages ofdevelopment, which are expected to add 538,762 total square meters of GLA,representing an increase of approximately 6% on the company's current GLA during2019-2022. Additionally, FUNO participate in the joint-venture Mitikah, whichincludes the development of retail, offices and residential areas in the southof Mexico City. FUNO maintains a 62.1% participation in the joint-venture on theretail and office developments. Fitch expectations for FUNO's 2019-2022 netleverage already incorporate the incremental debt required to finance theproject. Expected Business Deleverage Incorporated: Fitch views FUNO's capital structureas consistent with the 'BBB' rating category, which include expectations on thecompany's key credits of net debt/EBITDA, net loan-to-value, and unencumberedassets/net unsecured debt consistently at levels around 5.5x, 32%, and, 3x,respectively, during 2019-2021. The ratings incorporate prospects for thecompany's net debt/EBITDA ratio to progressively declines toward 2020. FUNO'snet leverage ratio was 6x at March 31, 2019. It reflects LTM EBITDA, total debt,and cash levels of MXN13.2 billion, MXN81.7 billion, and MXN3.3 billion,respectively. By the end of 2019 and 2020, the company's net leverage isforecasted at levels of 6.2x and 5.7x, respectively. DERIVATION SUMMARY The ratings reflect FUNO's solid market position as the largest Fibra (REIT) inMexico. The ratings take into account the company's large, well-diversifiedportfolio of industrial, retail and office properties, strong franchise value,diversified tenant base, high occupancy rates, credit metrics aligned with therating level, and adequate financial flexibility in the form of good access todebt and equity markets, in conjunction with unsecured committed credit lines,and an important unencumbered asset pool. FUNO's ratings are limited by itsexternally advised and internally managed structure and aggressive growthstrategy. FUNO is well positioned relative to peers in the 'BBB' rating category in termsof the scale and diversification of its property portfolio as well as in termsof access to capital markets. FUNO's portfolio as of March 31, 2019 included 559operating units with 8.7 million square meters of GLA. The total GLA breakdownwas 39% retail, 47% industrial and 14% office. The company's average annualrevenue is expected to be around USD1 billion million during 2019-2020. No otherregional peer presents similar degrees of scale and diversification. Fitch considers the company's access to capital markets superior to regionalpeers. FUNO has issued approximately USD5.9 billion in equity - including itsIPO in 2011 - as well as several debt issuances in the international and localmarkets. Fitch also views FUNO's liquidity position as stronger than regionalpeers based on its capacity to maintain an unencumbered assets base ofapproximately USD10 billion plus unused committed credit lines for approximatelyMXN15 billion. FUNO's rating compares well with regional real estate peers in the 'BBB' ratingcategory in terms of capital structure and margins. In terms of net financialleverage, its net debt to EBITDA is expected to trend to levels around 5.5xduring 2019-2020, which Fitch views as adequate when compared with otherregional peers. Fibra Terrafina (BBB-/Stable) and Corporacion Inmobiliaria VestaS.A. (BBB-/Stable) are expected to reach net leverage metrics around 5.5x and 6xrespectively during the same period. FUNO's EBITDA margin is forecast at around 75% during 2019-2020, which Fitchviews as relatively weaker when compared with regional peers. Fibra Terrafinaand Corporacion Inmobiliaria Vesta S.A. (Vesta) are expected to reach EBITDAmargins around 83%, for both, during the same period. In terms of interestcoverage, FUNO's EBITDA/net Interest ratio is anticipated around 2.3x during2019-2020, which Fitch views as lower than expected levels for Fibra Terrafinaand Vesta of around 3.5x and 3.7x, respectively, during the same period.

RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive RatingAction --Stabilization of the portfolio profitability as asset mix evolves; --Fitch's expectation of sustained net leverage below 4.0x, while maintainingrobust unencumbered asset coverage above 3.0x. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative RatingAction --An FFO dividend payout ratio consistently exceeding 100%; --Fitch's expectation of sustained net leverage above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustained below 2.0x; --Unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt (UA/UD) consistently below 3.0x. LIQUIDITY Solid Liquidity Provides Financial Flexibility: FUNO has a good base-caseliquidity considering the company's capacity to cover interest expenses andmanageable debt schedule. No material debt principal payments are due untilafter Dec. 31, 2021. FUNO also has significant levels of unencumbered assets andhigh levels of unused committed credit lines. The company has cash andequivalents of MXN3.3 billion as of March 31, 2019 and availability equivalentto MXN15 billion. The company's interest coverage ratio, measured as totalEBITDA-to-net interests, is forecasted to be around 2.3x during 2019-2021. FUNO's unencumbered asset to net unsecured debt coverage ratio is estimated tobe 3x as of March 31, 2019. The company increased its unencumbered asset basefrom around 70% of unencumbered assets in its portfolio in 2015, to close to 90%as of March 31, 2019 after a series of unsecured debt issuances in the domesticand international markets. Fitch estimates FUNO's debt structure will remainrelatively stable with unsecured debt representing more than 90% of total debtin the foreseeable future.

"By Orfa Mejia TEGUCIGALPA, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Honduran President JuanOrlando Hernandez on Saturday denied reports from a U.S. courtfiling linking him to drug trafficking, accusing criminals ofseeking revenge against him. ""The drug traffickers are looking for revenge against theonly president who's done what he's needed to do,"" he told anews conference, detailing his efforts to curb illegal drugsales in the small Central American country where drug gangshave prominent strongholds. Hernandez specifically opposed a report from U.S.-basedSpanish language broadcaster Univision in which he said he wasdescribed as implicated in a campaign finance conspiracy. Univision had detailed a 44-page document related to theupcoming drug trafficking trial in New York of Hernandez'sbrother, Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez, that contained testimonyfrom someone who appeared to be a former official. ""These are false accusations made by a drug trafficker,""Hernandez said, while acknowledging that such a document hadbeen put before a U.S. judge. The Honduran president, a conservative lawyer who came topower in 2014, has reined in homicides with a tough policyagainst drug cartels and street gangs that has been supported bythe United States and criticized by human rights groups. In May, a U.S. court filing showed that U.S. authorities hadtargeted Hernandez in an investigation of large-scale drugtrafficking and money laundering, related to the drugtrafficking case against Hernandez's brother. Tony Hernandez was arrested in Miami in November. A leaderof the Cachiros gang had testified during a 2017 trial in NewYork that Tony Hernandez had taken a bribe to help launder drugfunds.

"MOSCOW, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Russian wheat export prices ended higher for the fifth week running as increased inspections by the agriculture safety watchdog unnerved the market, analysts said on Monday. The watchdog, Rosselkhoznadzor, has been beefing up quality controls in recent weeks. Traders watch closely for any changes to regulations because such moves have been used in the past to place informal curbs on exports. Black Sea prices for Russian wheat with 12.5 percent protein content and for delivery in October were $232 per tonne on a free on board (FOB) basis at the end of last week, up from $228 a week earlier, Russian agricultural consultancy IKAR said in a note. SovEcon, another Moscow-based consultancy, quoted FOB wheat prices up $1 at $230 a tonne, while barley was up $2 at $234 a tonne. Rosselkhoznadzor said last week that it would inspect grain loadings at ports across Russia due to complaints from major buyers about falling crop standards. ""We expect the agency to continue unnerving the market in the near future,"" SovEcon analysts wrote. ""However, at the moment we continue to believe that we are not talking about a major campaign to close grain terminals,"" SovEcon said. On Thursday, SovEcon upgraded its forecast for Russia's 2018 grain crop by 700,000 tonnes to 109 million tonnes. IKAR also raised its total grain crop estimate for Russia on Monday, to 110.5 million tonnes from 109.3 million tonnes. Russian farmers had harvested 108.7 million tonnes of grain by Oct. 12 from 95 percent of the harvesting area, data from the Agriculture Ministry showed. As of Oct. 11, Russia, one of the world's largest grain exporters, had exported 16.7 million tonnes of grain since the start of the 2018/19 season on July 1, SovEcon said. That was up 24 percent compared to the same period the previous year and included 14.4 million tonnes of wheat. Sunflower seed prices fell by 650 roubles to 18,475 roubles a tonne, SovEcon said. Export sunflower oil prices were down by $5 at $660 per tonne, the agency said. IKAR's white sugar price index for southern Russia was at $539 a tonne on Oct. 12, down $15 from a week earlier.

"(Refiles to amend name in paragraph six to conform with convention) SINGAPORE, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Singapore has launched a government agency on Tuesday to support infrastructure projects across Asia, which need billions of dollars in funding, and make them more appealing to financial institutions and private investors. The global financial hub's decision to position itself as a broker for regional infrastructure investment came in after China ramped up efforts to fund and build transport and trade links in dozens of countries as part of its Belt-and-Road Initiative. Flagged earlier this year, Singapore's 'Infrastructure Asia' agency will be led by its central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and Enterprise Singapore, an arm of the trade ministry. Asia is estimated to face an investment gap of $460 billion annually for infrastructure, according to estimates from the Asian Development Bank. Analysts say some governments have struggled to prepare infrastructure deals in a way that is 'bankable' and attracts private sector investment. ""With better knowledge, skills and resources, we can improve project feasibility and bankability, enabling project leads to become viable commercial projects,"" said Seth Tan Keng Hwee, executive director at Infrastructure Asia.

"By Ginger Gibson March 16 (Reuters) - During Sunday night's debate, former Vice President Joe Biden vowed to select a woman as his running mate if he becomes the Democratic nominee for president. Biden, who is vying with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the nomination, has said there is a deep bench of women he can choose from, including several who made their own strong runs for the nomination, as well as governors and Congress members. While women have appeared as a presidential or vice presidential nominee on major party tickets before, no woman has ever served as vice president. Some women who are likely to be considered: FORMER RIVALS U.S. Senator Kamala Harris Since being elected California attorney general in 2010, Harris, 55, has been a rising star in the Democratic Party. Since the senator from California ended her presidential bid in December, she has been at the center of vice presidential speculation. Harris held out until after primary voting in her state, where Sanders won, before endorsing Biden. But she campaigned for him on the eve of a crucial Michigan primary last week, which Biden won. Since her home state is a reliable Democratic stronghold, she would not bring to the ticket a potentially decisive battleground state - hotly contested because voters can swing either to Republican or Democrats. But as the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, she could help rally black voters, a crucial Democratic voting bloc. U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar The 59-year-old senator from Minnesota's questioning of Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing boosted her national profile - and she defied expectations in the Democratic primary. Klobuchar endorsed Biden as she exited the race after on the eve of March 3rd's pivotal Super Tuesday contests, helping him win her home state. Picking her as a running mate would be viewed as a play to help win critical Northern states, including Minnesota, where Democrat Hillary Clinton won by only 1 percentage point in 2016 and which Republican President Donald Trump is hoping to flip this year. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren An academic who wrote books on bankruptcy law, Warren, 70, arrived on the political scene in 2008 when she was tapped to help oversee big bank bailouts and then help Democratic President Barack Obama establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Her policy proposals are much more progressive than Biden's. Choosing the senator from Massachusetts as a running mate could be a powerful sign that Biden wants to embrace the party's left wing. STATEHOUSE STARS Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer Whitmer, 48, has been a rising Democratic Party star since winning a tight race in Michigan in 2018. Party leadership tapped her to deliver the response to Trump's State of the Union address last year. She has already tamped down speculation she could be the nominee. On Monday, she told MSNBC she is happy to help vet possible Biden running mates, saying, ""It's not going to be me, but I am going to have a hand in helping make sure that he has the rounded-out ticket that can win.” Trump shocked American politics by winning Michigan in 2016, and picking Whitmer would be seen as a move to help flip the state back into the Democratic column. Former Georgia Minority Leader Stacey Abrams In her failed bid to become Georgia's governor in 2018, Abrams, 46, gained a national profile. Some Democrats called on the African-American woman from the Deep South to make a run for president in 2020. Instead, Abrams has focused her attention on building a group working to end voter suppression and helping people register to vote. While she has minimal executive government experience, Abrams would likely bring enthusiasm to a ticket with Biden, especially among African Americans. CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth A veteran of Asian descent, the 52-year-old from Illinois lost both her legs in the Iraq War before being elected to the Senate. Duckworth has notched several firsts, including being one of the first women to fly helicopter combat missions, the first woman to become a wartime double amputee, the first woman double amputee elected to the Senate and the first senator to give birth while in office. Duckworth would be the first Asian American to be nominated by a major party to be a vice presidential running mate. U.S. Representative Val Demings The African-American congresswoman from Florida's national profile rose earlier this year when she was tapped as one of the managers, effectively prosecutors, in the House impeachment proceedings against Trump. Demings, 63, was first elected to office in 2016. Before going to Washington, she was a police officer. She hails from a state that could be critical in 2020. But her law enforcement background may not please some who are critical of Biden's track record on criminal justice.

"By James Pearson HANOI, April 10 (Reuters) - Vietnam is challenging China's dominance of coronavirus diplomacy with the donation of medical supplies to Europe and Southeast Asia and even winning plaudits from U.S. President Donald Trump for a shipment of protective suits. China is looking to burnish its credentials as a responsible power by sharing expertise and donating masks and other protective equipment to countries seeing a surge in cases and to repair an image dented by the disease that originated there late last year. Vietnam, despite its lack of resources compared with its giant neighbour, has donated 550,000 face masks to France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain, and 390,000 to neighbouring Cambodia and 340,000 to another neighbour, Laos. It has also capitalised on the U.S. government's purchase of 450,000 made-in-Vietnam DuPont hazmat suits by expediting the shipment of the protective equipment, and using it to highlight its medical donations in public statements and state media. Trump thanked ""our friends in Vietnam"" on Thursday for that shipment. Helped by a mass quarantine and aggressive contact-tracing, Vietnam's health ministry has recorded 255 cases of the novel coronavirus and no deaths. Vu Duc Dam, a deputy prime minister who has been widely praised for his role in leading the campaign against the coronavirus, said on Monday the outbreak was under control. The next day, state media showed photos of European ambassadors receiving boxes of masks from Vietnam's foreign ministry in a ceremony showcasing the donation. ""Vietnam appears to have gained in confidence by managing to deal successfully with the coronavirus,"" said Carl Thayer, an expert in Vietnam's diplomacy at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra. ""While Vietnam is bracing itself against a second wave of the virus it is also beginning to look ahead to a revival of economic activity,"" Thayer said. Key to spurring that activity will be a much-anticipated EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA), said Thayer, which Vietnam's rubber stamp National Assembly will ratify later this month. AID 'WHERE IT COUNTS' There are now 40 firms producing 7 million fabric masks a day in Vietnam, the government said on Thursday. An additional 5.72 million surgical masks can be produced daily, it said. Vietnam is not the only country keen to show that it is able to offer its support to the world, however. Taiwan, which China claims as its sacred territory and locks out of most global organisations, is donating 16 million masks, mostly to Europe and the United States, earning the diplomatically isolated island rare prominence on the world stage. The government of Taiwan, which like Vietnam has managed to keep its tally of coronavirus cases low, with just five deaths, has not drawn a direct link between its virus diplomacy and that of China, but has been keen to show how ""Taiwan can help"", especially as it can make more than 13 million masks a day. South Korea has also won attention for its campaign against the virus and on Thursday it hosted an online presentation outlining its containment measures for about 400 health officials and experts from 13 countries, including the United States, Mexico, and Italy. ""We've been getting requests from many countries for us to share our know-how,"" a South Korean foreign ministry official told Reuters. Vietnam has also not explicitly compared its virus diplomacy to China's but it was quick to send supplies to old allies Laos and Cambodia, where its influence has waned in recent years while China's has surged. Even though Vietnam needs similar equipment in its own efforts against the virus, it has made donations to neighbours with large Vietnamese communities ""on the basis of traditional friendship and relations"", foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told Reuters. Vietnam could also be pushing the quality of its medical supplies in light of mounting returns to China of faulty equipment, said Thayer. Vietnam's biggest listed firm, Vingroup, said last week it would start producing up to 55,000 ventilators a month, including for foreign markets. ""Vietnam cannot hope to match China in the volume and dollar value of its aid but Vietnam can provide assistance where it counts,"" said Thayer.

"By Beh Lih Yi KUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - South Korea isset to legalize abortion after a decades-long ban was struckdown, but women's rights campaigners have warned those whoundergo the procedure will still be ""punished in the eyes ofsociety."" In a landmark verdict last week, a South Korean court ruledthe ban - which dates from 1953 - unconstitutional and asked thegovernment to legalize abortion by the end of 2020. Under the ban, as it currently stands, women who haveabortions can be jailed for up to a year and get a fine, whiledoctors who perform the procedure at the woman's request canface imprisonment of up to two years. The ruling was lauded as a victory for gender equality, butwomen's rights activists said conservative values mean women -even doctors - would still face stigma, hampering access toabortion. ""Even if women are no longer criminals under the law forabortion, they will still be punished in the eyes of thesociety,"" Jiann Woo, who has organized protests against the bansince 2016, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""Abortion is still seen as immoral here - it is onlysomething that the 'single, naughty girls' would do,"" added the25-year-old student, co-founder of Femidangdang, a Seoul-basedwomen's rights group. The Roman Catholic Church, with 5 million adherents - out ofa population of 51 million in South Korea - has taken a firmstance against the ruling. ""A nation has a responsibility to protect its people's lifeand safety under any circumstances,"" Seoul's Roman CatholicArchbishop Andrew Yeom Soo-jung said, adding he is ""worried""over the ruling. ""Every life, from the moment of conception, should beprotected as a human being,"" he added in a statement. South Korea became one of the last developed countries whereabortion is a crime after Ireland voted in a referendum lastyear to overturn its highly restrictive abortion laws. A survey by polling firm Realmeter this month showed morethan 58 percent of South Korean respondents favor scrapping theban, but a little over 30 percent wanted it retained. 'HUGE TABOO' The court ruling comes amid a burgeoning feminism movementin South Korea after tens of thousands of women took to thestreets last year to protest against illicit filming of women- so-called ""spycam porn."" But society's traditional, patriarchal views on women andtheir sexuality are still deeply rooted in the East Asiancountry which ranked 115 out of 149 countries in the WorldEconomic Forum's 2018 Global Gender Gap report. ""Abortion is still a huge taboo because our society hasstrict views on women's sexuality,"" said Yong, a South Koreanstudent living in Germany who underwent an abortion in March. ""I made a stupid mistake but I knew I had options. ""Many friends back home who had abortions had a verydifferent reaction - it was like the end of the world for them,""said the 27-year-old, who asked not to be named in full toprotect her privacy. Exemptions under current South Korean law allow abortionswithin 24 weeks of pregnancy in cases involving rape, hereditarydisease or danger to a mother's health. Abortion numbers have been dropping in South Korea, withnearly 50,000 estimated for women between 15 and 44 in 2017,down from some 340,000 in 2005, as birth control measures spreadand the population of women in that age range falls, said theKorea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. But campaigners say the ban has driven women to turn toblack-market abortion drugs, and pushed the cost of surgicalabortion prohibitively high with the fees for a late-termtermination averaging about $5,000. In many cases, women must also give a written promise thatthey will not implicate the doctor. The constitutional court challenge stemmed from the case ofa doctor who was charged with conducting nearly 70 illegalabortions. WEAKER LAW Beyond the Catholic Church, some of the world's largestmegachurches and church-affiliated groups in South Korea haveled the protest against making abortion legal. The Catholic Bishops' Conference of Korea has said theruling denied embryos' rights to life, while a group callingitself the National Alliance Against Abolition of Abortiondecried the procedure as an ""act of murder."" The issue is divisive among the medical fraternity, too. Gynecologist Yoon Jung-won, who has conducted hundreds ofabortions for rape survivors, said some doctors have called forthe right to not perform the procedure after the court liftedthe ban. ""Some doctors don't want to perform abortion simply becauseit is a stigmatized job. It'll take time and effort,"" said Yoon,who works in a private hospital in Seoul that specializes insexual assault cases. ""Law and policy change is the first (step) - culture andsocial change is the last and the most difficult one."" At the hospital where she works, Yoon has had to turn awaymany women over the years - from teenage girls who becomepregnant, to women who feel they are too poor for another childto those who are trapped in an abusive relationship. The government has said it would respect the court'sdecision and take steps to comply, however some campaigners likeWoo fear the 2020 deadline would give religious groups time tolobby for restrictions. President Moon Jae-in, a Catholic and a liberal, has notstated clearly if he supports abortion, but has called for morediscussions to build consensus. Ryu Min-hee, a lawyer in the legal team that mounted thesuccessful court challenge, said the onus is now on thegovernment to ensure abortions are accessible to women anddoctors are adequately trained. ""It's the government's duty to implement the ruling,"" saidRyu, adding ""It's not a crime, it's women's rights.""",FEATURE-Only for 'naughty girls': stigma lingers after S.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-London-March 25: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Land SecuritiesCapital Markets Plc's (LSCM/the security group) secured notes at 'AAsf' with aStable Outlook. A full list of ratings is below. KEY RATING DRIVERS The strong overall quality of the property portfolio held in the security group,as well as the robust covenant regime and low leverage, support the highinvestment-grade ratings on the notes. This is despite the correction in Londonprime real estate values that is underway. The debt programme affords considerable flexibility to LSCM in terms ofportfolio composition, debt issuance and leverage. Given Fitch's view ofLandsec's strong underlying corporate credit strength and investment trackrecord, a ""worst case"" asset or liability composition analysis is notundertaken. Instead, the ratings are based on our assessment of the coverageprovided by the actual portfolio on existing debt during its full life. The portfolio has a high-occupancy, diverse and good-quality tenant base, aweighted average lease length of more than eight years and predominantly primeasset quality. The longevity of the rental income profile and asset quality iscomplemented by largely fixed-rate liabilities with an average maturity of morethan 12 years (excluding unsecured ECP issuance). The secured leverage level remains low at an LTV ratio of 21%, but Landseccontinues to issue euro commercial paper (ECP) out of the security group,increasing from under GBP300 million in 2015 to GBP1 billion as of 15 March2019. Although the ECP is unsecured, the revolving credit facilities provide abackstop to the issuance should refinancing not be an option. In this scenario,the Priority 1 debt balance would increase, effectively reclassifying unsecureddebt as secured debt. In its analysis, Fitch has modelled aggregate secured andunsecured debt balance, increasing the reported LTV to around 27%. Fitch has analysed refinancing risk, including unsecured debt alongside secureddebt, using its CMBS analysis, with specific reference to its loan ratingmethodology, given that the mechanism to provision for upcoming maturitiescommences just 12 month prior to bond maturity. Without a longer tail period,there is reliance on sponsor willingness to repay debt (measured by itsremaining equity), to cover outstanding liabilities over time. We would expectthe sponsor's motivation to secure refinancing to increase two years ahead ofbond maturity when its coupon steps up. This additional sponsor risk is addressed in Fitch's analysis by applying adownward adjustment to the breakeven rating analysis. In view of the strongcovenant package, the high collateral quality and the creditor-friendlyjurisdiction, this adjustment is limited to one rating category, resulting inthe 'AAsf' rating. VARIATIONS FROM CRITERIA None RATING SENSITIVITIES A material increase in leverage or deterioration in the quality of assets heldin the security group would likely lead to multi-notch negative rating action.Assuming no changes in portfolio composition, an increase in net debt that wouldpush the Fitch 'Bsf' loan-to-value (LTV) above the current level of 42% couldlead to negative rating action. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch inrelation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it hasreceived about the performance of the asset pool and the transaction. There wereno findings that were material to this analysis. Fitch has not reviewed theresults of any third-party assessment of the asset portfolio information orconducted a review of origination files as part of its ongoing monitoring. Fitch did not undertake a review of the information provided about theunderlying asset pool ahead of the transaction's initial closing. The subsequentperformance of the transaction over the years is consistent with the agency'sexpectations given the operating environment and Fitch is therefore satisfiedthat the asset pool information relied upon for its initial rating analysis wasadequately reliable. Overall and together with the assumptions referred to above, Fitch's assessmentof the information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to itsapplicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable.

Cardiff have managed only two goals on their travels so far this season and though they matched Everton for pace and intensity for much of the game, their inability to create decent scoring opportunities cost them once again.

"NEW YORK, April 9 (Reuters) - The United States is expected to import 3.88 million tonnes of sugar in the 2019-20 season, the U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) said on Thursday, a sharp increase from its previous estimate as additional quotas have been approved. On its monthly supply and demand report (WASDE), the USDA boosted its estimate for imports by 540,000 tonnes, a bit more than the additional volumes approved to the tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) that total around 500,000 tonnes. The report kept U.S. sugar production basically stable at 8.038 million tonnes, as well as total use of the sweetener at 12.26 million tonnes. With the changes in expected imports, the stocks to use ratio, a key indicator watched by the market, that had fallen to only 7.2% in March, went up to 11.7%. ""The stocks to use is 221,000 tonnes short of the 13.5% number they like to hit, so that leaves the door open for another TRQ,"" said Michael McDougall, managing partner at Paragon Global Markets in New York, referring to the possibility of additional tariff-rate quotas being released. ""Or, they left domestic usage the same as last month, so they see no impact from the virus? I think they might hold off on TRQ to see if consumption is not impacted first,"" the analyst said.

"By Marcelo Teixeira SAO PAULO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A bid by U.S.-based fund Amerra Capital Management LLC to buy one of the mills from Brazilian sugar and ethanol producer Clealco failed to win approval from a group of creditors of the Brazilian company. Clealco, which filed for bankruptcy protection in July, said late on Monday that Amerra's bid of $47 million for its Queiroz mill, one of the three mills the company operates in Brazil, was not approved, at a meeting on Monday, by creditors who have a total debt estimated at around 1 billion reais ($238.03 million). Amerra, a fund specialized in distressed assets and high-yield financing, is also a creditor of Clealco, which is proposing in its in-court recovery plan to sell the Queiroz plant to pay back most creditors. Amerra already controls a sugar and ethanol plant in Brazil, the Naviraí mill in Mato Grosso do Sul state, which it acquired from Brazil's Infinity, a company that filed for bankruptcy protection in the troubled Brazilian sugar sector. A third bankruptcy case involving Amerra is linked to local grain trader Seara Agro, which is selling some assets such as port terminals and elevators as part of its recovery plan. Clealco said in a statement that creditors thought the bid did not value the Queiroz mill properly.

" (Updates prices)     * Canadian dollar at C$1.3208, or 75.71 U.S. cents     * Bank of Canada hikes 25 basis points to 1.50 percent     * Price of U.S. oil falls 5 percent     * Bond prices mixed across flatter yield curve      By Fergal Smith     TORONTO, July 11 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened to a more than one-week low against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday as broad-based gains for the greenback offset an interest rate hike and the prospect of further tightening by the Bank of Canada.     The U.S. dollar        rose as the market put aside trade tension fears and focused on an expectation-beating inflation report, which increased prospects that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates two more times this year.                  ""This U.S. dollar move offsets and even more so the somewhat hawkish BoC hike,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.     The Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.50 percent, the fourth hike since last summer.     It said mounting trade tensions with the United States would have a larger impact on investment and exports than previously thought, but it nudged up its estimate for second-quarter economic growth and pointed to rising inflation pressures.                  ""This should be consistent with a more firm pricing for another hike this year,"" said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in New York.     Money markets see a nearly 70 percent chance of further tightening by December.     At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading 0.7 percent lower at C$1.3208 to the greenback, or 75.71 U.S. cents.     The currency touched its strongest since June 14 at C$1.3064 and its weakest since July 2 at C$1.3215.     Losses for the loonie came as the United States threatened tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, pressuring stocks and commodity prices.                  Canada, which has its own trade dispute with the United States, exports many commodities and runs a current account deficit, so its economy could also be hurt if the flow of trade or capital slows.     U.S. crude oil futures        settled 5 percent lower at$70.38 a barrel.           Canadian government bond prices were mixed across a flatter yield curve, with the two-year            down 2 Canadian cents to yield 1.948 percent and the 10-year             rising 8 Canadian cents to yield 2.141 percent.     The gap between the two-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 3.3 basis points to a spread of -62.6 basis points.

"(Add background, details) Jan 31 (Reuters) - PennEast Pipeline Co LLC said on Friday it has asked federal energy regulators for permission to build the Pennsylvania part of its proposed natural gas pipeline first due to difficulty in gaining approvals in New Jersey. The company said in a filing with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that it expects to be able to complete the Pennsylvania section of the pipeline by November 2021. As for New Jersey, the company said it was targeting completion of the second phase of the project from Pennsylvania into New Jersey in 2023. FERC approved PennEast's request to build the pipeline in January 2018, and the company promptly sued in federal court under the U.S. Natural Gas Act to use the federal government's eminent domain power to gain access to properties along the route. New Jersey, however, opposed construction of the pipeline and did not consent to PennEast's condemnation suits on properties the state owns or in which it has an interest. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in September that the company could not use federal eminent domain to condemn land controlled by the state. That prompted PennEast to ask FERC for a ruling on the issue. FERC on Thursday ruled in favor of PennEast's view. After FERC's ruling, PennEast said it would still take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court because the FERC decision alone cannot trump the Third Circuit decision. PennEast needs the New Jersey land to build its 120-mile (193-km) pipeline, which is designed to deliver 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus shale formation in Pennsylvania to customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for one day. The companies seeking to build the $1 billion PennEast project include units of South Jersey Industries Inc, New Jersey Resources Corp (NJR), Southern Co, Enbridge Inc and UGI Corp. Companies with contracts to use the project include units of NJR, SJI, Southern, Public Service Enterprise Group Inc and Consolidated Edison Inc. PennEast is not the only gas pipeline facing state opposition in the U.S. Northeast. Two of Williams Cos Inc's proposed pipelines face state opposition, including the Constitution project in New York and the Northeast Supply Enhancement project in New Jersey.

"MEXICO CITY, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Police in London on Tuesday detained Karime Macias, the wife of a disgraced former Mexican state governor who is serving a 9-year jail sentence for money laundering and links to organized crime, a spokesman for Mexico's attorney general's office said. Macias will now face an extradition trial in Britain, the spokesman said. A judge in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, where Macias' husband Javier Duarte governed from 2010 to 2016, issued a warrant for her arrest in 2018 for the alleged misuse of over 112 million pesos ($5.9 million) in funds from a social welfare program. Prosecutors argued that Duarte, a member of former President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), headed an organization whose criminal operations were carried out in Veracruz, the eastern Gulf state of Campeche and Mexico City between 2011 and 2016. Top Mexican auditor ASF said in 2016 that the irregularities in public funds under Duarte were the most it had ever seen. A letter by Macias, which news site Animal Politico had obtained in December 2017 and posted online, indicated that Macias was living in Britain and that she had demanded back artwork, golf clubs and crystal that Mexican authorities had seized. In the letter, Macias also said she was forced to shelter in Britain because of ""persecution"" back home in Mexico.

The surprise resignation of Park Sam-koo, who also quit aschairman of the group and co-CEO of its biggest shareholderKumho Industrial, comes after the two firms failedto get auditors' sign-offs on their annual reports last week. That triggered warnings of credit ratings downgrades, asharp earnings revision for Asiana, and a massive stock-marketsell-off of the two firms on Tuesday when shares resumed tradingafter a two-day trading halt. Asiana’s shares jumped as much as 15.1 percent on Thursdayfollowing news of Park’s resignation but pared gains to close2.9 percent higher, while Kumho Industrial ended up losing 2.1percent after rising as much as 8.2 percent. ""His resignation could darken the clouds over one of SouthKorea’s biggest airlines as the company faces critical moments,""said Yang Ji-hwan, an analyst at Daishin Securities. Kumho Asiana Group said in a statement that Park met thechairman of the group’s main creditor, Korea Development Bank(KDB), late on Wednesday and asked for help to normalise AsianaAirlines, the conglomerate's flagship firm. It said it will launch an ""emergency management committeeheaded by vice chairman of the group to normalise our managementin a short period of time and will hire a respectable personoutside the company as the new chairman."" KDB said in a statement on Thursday that it planned to workwith the airline to improve its financial structure. Asiana has already sold assets to improve cash flow andreduce debt from aircraft purchases, as it battles rising fuelcosts and competition from low-cost carriers. The carrier had to revise its accounts and disclose a biggerannual loss this week to win auditor approval for its 2018financial statements after the auditor raised doubts about thestatements. It also said its debt amounted to more than sixtimes its equity. Asiana's bigger rival Korean Air Lines is alsoin management turmoil after shareholders removed chief executiveCho Yang-ho from its board in a landmark vote on Wednesday,making him the first founding family member of any South Koreancorporate giant to be forced off a board. IMAGE SETBACK The accounting fiasco comes after Asiana suffered an imagesetback in July when it was unable to provide meals on someflights after a change in caterer left the airline short. Itprompted Park to make a public apology at that time. The airline had two CEOs, and with Park stepping down, HanChang-su remains its sole CEO.

"* Bund yields rise from record lows * Stimulus hopes grow * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Updates prices for close) By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Germany's safe-haven government bond yields rose sharply from record-low levels on Tuesday, as oil prices bounced 7% and hopes for stimulus to support global growth in the face of the coronavirus outbreak helped stem market panic. Having slid over 13 basis points on Monday in the biggest one-day drop since the euro zone debt crisis in 2011, two-year German bond yields rose as much as 10 basis points at one point at -0.92% - well above record lows. They eased to 0.94% towards close of trade. ""Obviously, we had historic moves yesterday so there is a reversal of that today,"" said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a rates strategist at Rababank. ""There's a bit more confidence out there after the Trump news and also an element of profit-taking on the bond price gains."" U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would be taking ""major"" steps to gird the economy against the impact of the spreading coronavirus. Japan on Tuesday unveiled a second package of measures worth about $4 billion in spending, focusing on support to small and mid-sized firms. Europe's response to coronavirus could dominate Britain's first post-Brexit budget on Wednesday, while the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday is expected to weigh in with measures to support the euro zone economy. The prospect of stimulus measures bought calm to world markets after a day of panic that sent bond yields in Germany and the United States to record lows. German government bond yields were 8 to 12 basis points higher on the day. The 10-year Bund yield slipped to -0.7% , almost 20 bps above Monday's record low. They inched lower as the day wore on, to trade 5 bps up on the day at 0.8% Dutch 10-year bond yields climbed 6 bps to -0.57% , well off Monday's record lows around -0.70%. ""What we are seeing is a significant swing in sentiment and that is about fiscal policy, especially in the U.S.,"" said DZ Bank rates strategist Sebastian Fellechner. But while yields on safe-haven bonds are off their lows, investors are still bracing for a severe economic shock. The U.S. bond curve out to 10 years yields below 1% and 10-year yields have fallen more than 100 bps this year. German Bund yields are down over 50 bps. Italian borrowing costs also fell as the country was placed under lockdown until next month, but 10-year yields which tumbled 11 bps at one point, gradually rose and stood two bps down on the day towards close at 1.39%.

"By Reuters Staff NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The outcome of second solid cancers following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is strongly related to cancer type, with pancreatic and lung cancer being among those with the poorest outcome, according to European researchers. Cancer is the main cause of death among patients who survive five years or more after allogeneic HSCT, Dr. André Tichelli of University Hospital Basel, in Switzerland, and colleagues observe in JAMA Oncology, online November 21. To gain further information on risks and susceptibility, the team examined data on more than 220,000 patients who underwent a transplant between 2000 and 2014. After a median follow-up of 3.65 years, 1.8% subsequently received a diagnosis of one of 18 different types of second solid cancers. Among the most frequent were lung, breast and prostate cancer. The five-year age-standardized overall survival was 47%. This was poorest for pancreas, lung, hepatobiliary, esophageal, brain and gastric cancers, with a median survival ranging only as high as a year. For endometrial, colorectal, sarcomas, ovarian, bladder, oropharyngeal and kidney cancers, the median survival was from two to 10 years. For melanoma, breast, prostate, cervix and thyroid cancers, the median survival was 10 years or more. For each type of cancer, the team calculated the death rate attributable to the second cancer compared with the expected death rate for the corresponding cancer in the general population. This was higher for melanoma, prostate, breast, kidney, bladder, colorectal and endometrial cancers, but not for the others. Given the higher risk of certain cancers, the researchers call for futher studies ""to identify whether patients with these cancers should be treated differently from the general population."" This, they add, ""will require close cooperation between oncologists and hematologists."" Dr. Tichelli did not respond to requests for comments.

"(Adds details, background) By Catarina Demony and Sergio Goncalves LISBON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Portugal's president accepted the line-up of a new minority Socialist government on Tuesday, with Mario Centeno, the mastermind behind the country's first balanced budget in over four decades, keeping his job as Finance Minister. Centeno, who is the current Eurogroup chief, is credited with devising a way to reverse many of the austerity policies of the previous administration while at the same time delivering the lowest budget deficit in 45 years of democracy. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with president, Prime Minister-designate Antonio Costa said the new government will be ""the continuity of what has been the governance of the last four years but more politically reinforced by election results"". In the cabinet list, proposed by Costa, Augusto Santos Silva remained foreign affairs minister. Health minister Marta Temido and economy minister Pedro Siza Vieira also kept their roles. There are no big surprises but some of the new names include former tourism secretary of state Ana Mendes Godinho who became employment minister. The Socialists are set take office next week, the president said in a statement. Costa was invited to form a new government on Tuesday last week after the Socialists won a general election on Oct. 6 but landed shy of a full majority. The election results led Costa to open talks with his far-left partners, the Communists and the Left Bloc, which backed him up in parliament over the past four years. Negotiations between Costa and party leaders are ongoing but he is unlikely to sign a written deal with far-left parties as happened in the previous administration. Left Bloc leader Catarina Martins accused Costa of refusing to sign a written deal after her party demanded changes to the labour law. ""By deciding to end the political agreement that became known as 'geringonca' (contraption), the Socialists rejected a model that has shown resistance to political turmoil,"" Martins said. Socialist Duarte Cordeiro, who sat at the negotiating table during the talks, argued last week that ""geringonca was not dead"" and said his party was still available to work with other parties. Passing legislating on a case-by-case basis could be risky for a minority Socialist government after four years in parliament with the support of his two far-left allies, analysts said. However, it could also open doors for more negotiations with the opposition. On Monday, the head of the state debt agency IGCP said international investors do not seem worried about political uncertainty in Portugal after election, as indicated by Portuguese yields remaining below their Spanish equivalents. After the election, Costa also met with the Greens, environmentalist People-Animals-Nature (PAN) party and the left-wing Livre.

"July 2 (Reuters) - U.S. retail vacancies rose marginally to 10.2 percent in the second quarter, hurt by bankrupt toy retailer Toys ""R"" Us Inc's store closures, real estate research firm Reis Inc said in a report on Monday. Toys ""R"" Us stores across the United States marked their final day in business on Friday. The store closings impacted the quarter's statistics ""more than any other retailer has in any quarter over the last nine years"", Reis said. The report said 55 of 77 metros reported a rise in vacancy compared with the second quarter last year, when U.S. retail real estate vacancies were at 10 percent. ""After withstanding the hundreds if not thousands of store closings over the last 18 months, the neighborhood and community shopping center industry suffered its worst quarter in nine years,"" the Reis report said. Net absorption was a negative of 3.8 million square feet, compared with 909,000 square feet in the year-ago quarter. Reis said it does not expect the vacancy rate to improve in the near future. The retail statistics somewhat mirror the retail employment numbers, with the sector experiencing positive job growth every month in 2018, and adding 125,100 jobs over the last 12 months, the report said. The national average asking rents edged 0.2 percent higher, as did the effective rent for the quarter, Reis said. Only 780,000 square feet of new construction was completed in the quarter, a 79.7 percent drop from a year earlier, according to the report.

"WASHINGTON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased by the most in more than a year in January, boosted by rises in the costs of services such as healthcare and hotel accommodation. The Labor Department said on Wednesday its producer price index for final demand jumped 0.5% last month, the largest gain since October 2018, after climbing 0.2% in December. In the 12 months through January, the PPI advanced 2.1%, the biggest increase since May, after rising 1.3% in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.1% in January and rising 1.6% on a year-on-year basis. Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices increased 0.4%, the most since April, after rising 0.2% in December. The so-called core PPI increased 1.5% in the 12 months through January, matching December's rise. The government last week reported a pickup in core consumer prices in January, which led economists to expect firmer readings in the inflation measure tracked by the Federal Reserve for its 2% inflation target. Economists are forecasting that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 0.2% in January, which would raise the annual increase to 1.7%, also as last year's weak readings are dropping out of the calculation. The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in December. It undershot its target in 2019. January PCE price data will be published next Friday. The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates unchanged after reducing borrowing costs three times in 2019. The Fed is expected to keep monetary policy on hold at least through this year. In January, wholesale energy prices fell 0.7% after jumping 1.5% in December. They were pulled down by a 1.5% drop in gasoline prices, which followed a 4.2% acceleration in December. Goods prices edged up 0.1% last month after increasing 0.3% in December. Wholesale food prices gained 0.2% in January after falling 0.3% in the prior month. Core goods prices increased 0.3% last month. They gained 0.2% in December. The cost of services rebounded 0.7% in January, the most since October 2018, after being unchanged in the prior month. Services accounted for 90% of the increase in the PPI last month. The cost of healthcare services rebounded 0.6% last month. Portfolio management fees accelerated 2.3% after jumping 1.9% in December. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index. There were also increases in the costs of hotel accommodation and machinery and vehicle wholesaling.

"By Sudip Roy LONDON, Aug 2 (IFR) - Eskom is marketing a US$1.5bn dual-tranche offering with a healthy pick-up over both the sovereign and its own curve as the troubled South African utility returns to the international bond markets for the first time in three years. The state-owned company, which provides more than 90% of South Africa's power, has opened books on a 10-year note guaranteed by the sovereign and a 10-year non-guaranteed issue. The US$1bn guaranteed deal is being marketed at yield IPTs of 6.50%-6.625%. That is roughly 100bp back of where South Africa paper is trading in the secondary market. The sovereign has Oct 2028s bid at 5.61%, according to Tradeweb prices, or a Z-spread of 254bp. The spread at the tight end of IPTs would be roughly 343bp over mid-swaps, while at the wide end it would be plus 355.5bp. On Wednesday, one investor told IFR he was hoping for a pick-up of more than 100bp versus the sovereign's curve for the guaranteed paper, given Eskom has a Triple C rating (it is B2 negative by Moody's and CCC+ negative by S&P). But a source not involved in the deal reckons those levels would represent a huge mispricing, given the note will be ""irrevocably and unconditionally"" guaranteed by the sovereign. ""It should be either 25bp back of the sovereign, as it's sovereign paper, or in line with where Eskom is trading, as you don't trust the guarantee,"" he said. However, given the guarantee means the notes immediately become a sovereign liability in the event of a non-payment by Eskom, there should not be any doubts. As for the US$500m non-guaranteed issue, Eskom has begun marketing at 8.625%-8.75%. The company's longest outstanding notes are its Feb 2025s, which were bid at 7.89% or a Z-spread of 486bp ahead of the pricing announcement. Those Feb 2025s trade more than 250bp back of the sovereign - South Africa has Sep 2025s bid at 5.32% or plus 228bp. The IPTs on the new notes, therefore, represent a much bigger pick-up - of some 300bp - compared to South Africa's Oct 2028s. Eskom's management is hoping that its reform story will lure sufficient demand. Last week Eskom said it had secured a US$2.5bn loan from China Development Bank, which means that it has raised 62% of its funding needs for this financial year. South Africa's ruling party also wants greater private-sector investment in the company, and has not ruled out the possibility of splitting up its operations. Talk, though, is one thing, action is another and the deal's success will come down to how much investors believe Eskom's future will be any different from its recent past, as the company became the most visible symbol of the previous government's mismanagement of the economy. In its last financial year, Eskom reported a loss of US$175m. It already has US$20bn of state-guaranteed debt. Drastic action is needed for a company that has 47,000 employees. While some sources questioned the deal's timing, given it's still very early days in the turnaround, Eskom needs money. An emergency R20bn bridge loan from February comes due at the end of August in addition to US$98.1m in coupon payments spread over the month. The deal is today's business via Barclays, JP Morgan and Standard Bank. The guaranteed notes are rated in line with the sovereign, at Baa3/BB. The non-guaranteed notes are B3/CCC+.

"By John Irish PARIS, March 14 (Reuters) - Thousands of French security forces fanned out across central Paris on Saturday as anti-government ""Yellow Vest"" protesters defied a ban on mass gatherings aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus. In a televised address to the nation on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron announced school closures and urged people to avoid close contact for fear of propagating the virus that has killed 79 people in France and infected more than 3,600. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner on Friday said all gatherings with more than 100 people had been banned. Paris police had already turned down requests for protesters to demonstrate at sensitive sites this Saturday, including the Champs Elysees where violent clashes broke out between security forces and protesters almost a year ago to the day. ""It's Saturday, demonstration day. Some people think that the coronavirus won't touch them and refuse to respect the advice,"" said a riot police officer in front of a heavily armed vehicle blocking the road that leads to the presidential palace. The government published an official decree on Saturday banning all non-essential gatherings, but hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective masks, began convening outside the Montparnasse train station, chanting anti-Macron slogans. The yellow vests, named after the high-visibility jackets they wear, were holding a 70th consecutive Saturday of action. The movement emerged late in 2018, triggered by fuel tax rises, and swelled into a revolt against Macron's government. While protests are now much smaller, anger at Macron's government remains. Saturday's demonstration serves as a remainder to the President a day before voters are set to go to the polls in local elections. The elections are an important test for the former investment banker with opponents now particularly angered by his plans to reform the French pensions system. His party is not expected to do well. ""We had to come and mark the day to tell Macron that we're still here and that we won't accept his pension reform,"" said one pensioner. Voters will begin choosing mayors for 35,000 town halls and almost half a million councillors on Sunday, overshadowed by the coronavirus outbreak which is expected to hit turnout at the vote, which is usually relatively high. Macron decided to go ahead with the elections despite the virus concerns, which have led the government to shut schools and universities, suspend major sporting events, curtail public transport and close tourism attractions. Disneyland Paris became the latest casualty on Saturday closing its doors until the end of March.

"(Adds detail, market reaction) BERLIN, May 16 (Reuters) - Swiss-listed eye care companyAlcon expects to boost sales 3 to 5% this yearfactoring out currency moves, it said on Thursday in its firststand-alone results report since spinning off from Novartisin April. ""Solid first-quarter results give us confidence in ourability to perform as an independent company and to continue toexecute on our key growth drivers,"" Chief Executive DavidEndicott said in a statement. Providing its first 2019 guidance, Alcon said it expected toachieve a 17 to 18% core operating margin this year, in linewith the 17.7% it reported for the first three months. It posted an operating loss of $48 million for the quarter,saying spin-off, software, and research and development costshad been a drag. Novartis had already reported last month that the eyedivision's revenue from January through March had risen 4% inconstant currency terms to $1.8 billion from the previous year.In dollar terms, Alcon's first-quarter revenues were flat. Since its April 9 spin-off created a $30 billion company bymarket capitalisation, its shares have risen about 12 percent.

"By Alan Baldwin LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Formula One owners Liberty Mediahave under-estimated the task of running the sport and must befirm in setting out a vision for the future, according to RedBull team boss Christian Horner. Speaking to reporters before the 2019 cars break cover nextweek, the Briton was also scathing of technical changes he saidhad been expensive to implement but would change little ontrack. The agreements between teams, the rights holders andgoverning body expire at the end of 2020 and U.S.-based Liberty,who took control two years ago, want closer racing and a morelevel playing field. That includes a budget cap and distributing revenues moreequally, as well as technical changes so that cars can follow atclose quarters and overtake more easily. The detail has yet to be defined, however, with resistancefrom wealthy teams who have historically enjoyed specialprivileges. ""I think they probably thought there was some very lowhanging fruit there and I think it's proved an awful lot harderthan they perhaps thought,"" Horner said of Liberty's initialapproach to the sport. ""You can window dress and promote a movie as much as youlike, but if the movie has not got the substance and isn't anexciting movie, people won't watch it."" Horner said Liberty had taken positive steps in areas suchas esports, digital platforms and promotion, but they needed toset out a clear post-2020 blueprint. ""As the owner of the sport they need to take a position of'this is what we want Formula One to be, here's the set ofregulations and here's the financials', and go with it,""declared the Briton. Promoters representing a majority of the tracks on thecalendar last week voiced concern about Liberty's handling ofthe sport. Horner said former commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone, whoran the sport for decades with an iron fist until 2017, wouldhave had a firmer response to that. ""The problem is the way that Liberty are operating, tryingto operate in a democratic way,"" he said. ""Bernie ran a really tight and hard ship. A dictatorship. Ifyou didn't like it, than you wouldn’t have a race the followingyear."" Formula One cars will have wider and simpler front wingsthis season, but Horner was sceptical about the changesimproving racing. ""They've cherry-picked something in isolation off a futureconcept for 2021 and rushed it through onto the current car.There's no silver bullet,"" he said. ""It has to be everything working in harmony with everythingelse. Just taking the front wing and saying that will makeracing better, it's quite a naive and ultimately expensiveapproach.""

"Feb 25 (Reuters) - Dutch gas company NAM intends to closeits Grijpskerk gas storage facility in the fourth quarter of2021, which is one of the last remaining large seasonal storagesites in Europe. Grijpskerk, operated by NAM, is an underground seasonal gasstorage site in the Netherlands. With a capacity of around 2.8billion cubic metres (bcm), it is one of the largest remainingseasonal storage sites in Europe. It is also one of two main sites used to provide supplyflexibility and balance production from the Groningen gas fieldin the Netherlands. Gas production from the Groningen field is due to end by2030 as decades of extraction have led to a series of damagingearthquakes in the region. Production there is already fallingfaster than planned, the Dutch government said this month. NAM intends to terminate a service agreement with Dutch gastrading company GasTerra around the fourth quarter of 2021 forthe site and thereby terminate the ""storage functionality"" ofGrijpskerk, it said in a market message. The exact timing was not disclosed. The company was notimmediately available for comment. Gas storage is used as a buffer at times of high demand anddisrupted supply, which can result from infrastructure outages. Seasonal gas storage is important because at times of lowdemand and therefore low gas prices in the summer, gas isusually injected into storage to be kept for when demand risesin the winter. In 2017, Centrica decided to close Britain’s largest gasstorage facility, Rough, as it had become too costly to maintainthe ageing site, leaving the country with storage capacityequivalent to four to five days of winter demand. Across Europe, weak gas price spreads have not allowedoperators to cover their fixed costs, resulting in mothballingand closures.(Reporting by Nina Chestney in London; Editing by Mark Potter)",Dutch gas company NAM to close Grijpskerk storage facility in Q4 2021, dutch gas company nam intends to closeits grijpskerk gas storage facility in the fourth quarter of2021. grijpskerk is one of the last remaining large seasonal storagesites in europe. it is also one of two main sites used to provide supplyflexibility and balance production from the groningen gas field.,dutch gas company nam to close grijpskerk gas storage site in q4 2021
"By Phil Stewart SINGAPORE, Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will seek more resilient military ties during talks with his Chinese counterpart in Singapore slated for Thursday, a U.S. official said, as both militaries attempt to navigate mounting tensions. Mattis saw first hand last month how growing Sino-U.S. friction could undermine military contacts when Beijing up-ended plans for an October meeting in China with Defence Minister Wei Fenghe, in apparent retaliation over U.S. sanctions. A meeting with Wei now appears set to take place on the sidelines of a gathering of Asian defense ministers in Singapore. Randall Schriver, a U.S. assistant secretary of defense who helps guide Pentagon policy in Asia, said making military-to-military ties with China less brittle would be crucial to helping reduce the chances of a devastating conflict. ""Two nuclear-armed powers with regional, if not global, interests - we need to make sure that when we step on one another's toes, it doesn't escalate into something that would be catastrophic,"" Schriver told reporters traveling with Mattis. Schriver said he believed that sentiment was shared by China's military, noting that it recently requested Thursday's talks in Singapore after Beijing decided against a planned Mattis-Wei meeting in China. ""I think the fact that he's meeting with Minister Wei is some evidence that the Chinese are interested in keeping things normal and stable, as are we,"" said Schriver, assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs. He said Wei had a standing invitation to visit the United States. MANAGING CRISES Military-to-military ties have long been one of the more fragile parts of the overall U.S.-China relationship, with Beijing limiting contacts when tensions run high. That has been a source of major concern for years among U.S. officials, who fear an accidental collision or mishap could quickly escalate. ""What we want in terms of stability are regular interactions at senior levels so we have a good understanding of one another's intentions, that we have confidence-building measures that will help us prevent an unintended accident or incident,"" Schriver said. ""And, should one occur, that we have the ability to manage that so it doesn't worsen."" China has been infuriated by the United States putting sanctions on China's military for buying weapons from Russia, and by what Beijing sees as stepped-up U.S. support for self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by China as its sacred territory. In a recent reminder of the risks amid rising tensions, the Pentagon this month accused China of an unsafe and unprofessional maneuver in the South China Sea that brought a Chinese ship dangerously close to a U.S. Navy destroyer in international waters. Mattis, speaking to reporters as he flew to Asia this week, rejected Chinese claims that the United States was acting aggressively and pointed the finger at Beijing. ""When the Chinese ships are putting bumpers over the side ... You don't do that when you're out in the middle of the ocean, unless you're intending to run into something,"" Mattis said. But tensions between the United States and China have already extended well beyond naval maneuvers and even the bitter trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump last month accused China of seeking to meddle in Nov. 6 congressional elections, a charge almost immediately rejected by Beijing. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, in what was billed as a major policy address, renewed that and other accusations this month and added that Chinese security agencies had masterminded the ""wholesale theft of American technology,"" including military blueprints. The Pentagon's top concerns have been China's rapid military modernization and simultaneous creation of military outposts in the South China Sea, a strategic waterway vital for international trade. The Pentagon un-invited China to a multinational exercise earlier this year in protest. Mattis, Schriver said, will renew to Wei U.S. positions on freedom of navigation in international waters, amid Chinese claims of ""irrefutable"" sovereignty in the South China Sea. ""I think our message will be: No single country can change international law and national norms. We'll fly, sail and operate where international law allows,"" Schriver said.",Mattis to seek more resilient U.S. ties with China's military,u.s. defense secretary jim mattis will seek more resilient military ties during talks with his chinese counterpart in singapore. military-to-military ties have long been one of the more fragile parts of the overall u.s.-china relationship.,mattis to seek resilient military ties with china's wei in singapore talks amid rising tensions
"By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Nov 13 (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar boasted its biggest daily rise this year on Wednesday after the country's central bank surprised markets by keeping interest rates steady, wrongfooting bears who had wagered heavily on a cut. The kiwi dollar jumped 1.1% to $0.6405 as speculators were squeezed out of short positions, which had become a very crowded trade in recent weeks. The currency now needs to crack chart resistance at the November peak of $0.6466 to extend the rally. Bears were forced to scramble when the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) skipped a chance to cut rates, staying at 1% when the market had been odds-on for an easing. The central bank's next policy meeting is also not until February, too long a time for speculators to stay short. ""Today's decision shows that the RBNZ is not afraid to stare down financial markets,"" said Dominick Stephens, chief economist for New Zealand at Westpac. ""The RBNZ is certainly open to a February cut,"" he added. ""Our long-held view is that the low-point in the current rate cycle will be 0.75%."" The market was not so sure, with swap rates surging to imply only a 20% chance of a cut in February. Yields on two-year government bonds climbed 10 basis points to their highest since August at 1.00% - the sharpest daily rise since mid-2017. The Kiwi also jumped on its Australian neighbour, with the Aussie diving 1.2% to NZ$1.0678. That kept the Aussie flat on the U.S. dollar at $0.6873. Domestic Australian data was mixed with wage growth staying disappointingly subdued in the third quarter, while consumer sentiment became a little less gloomy this month. The annual pace of wage growth slowed to just 2.2%, when analysts had looked for a steady reading of 2.3%. That was a headache for the conservative government of Prime Minster Scott Morrison which needs much faster growth to meet its pledge of returning the budget to surplus. It had predicted growth would pick up to 2.5% by the middle of this year, and reach 2.75% for the year to June 2020 and a heady 3.25% the year after. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last week abandoned its long-held hope for an acceleration in pay awards, tipping an annual pace of 2.3% right out to end 2021. ""Growth remains dismal and, with the headwinds facing the economy unlikely to abate in the near term, we don't expect wages growth to accelerate markedly in the near term,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics. ""Given this backdrop, we expect the RBA to cut the cash rate again in early 2020, to 0.5%."" Australian government bond futures edged up on the data, with the three-year bond contract rising 2 ticks to 99.170. The 10-year contract firmed 1.5 ticks to 98.7250.

"(Adds testimony started, names banks involved) By Tim Cocks JOHANNESBURG, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Corruption under South Africa's former president Jacob Zuma was enabled by international banks, companies and governments which should now seek to recover the loot they helped to launder, British lawmaker Peter Hain told an inquiry on Monday. HSBC, Standard Chartered and India's Bank of Baroda as well as their senior directors were ""directly culpable"" in the looting of South Africa's treasury under Zuma, Hain said in his submission to the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture. Hain was invited to give evidence because he had already named several corporates he was investigating under parliamentary privilege in 2017 as complicit in state capture. HSBC said it fully supported the commission's inquiry. Standard Chartered and Bank of Baroda did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""They're all up to their neck in this,"" he told the inquiry at his appearance. ""They continued because of course the corporates concerned, including the banks, were making money out of it...The Guptas could not have amassed this illicit wealth without the corporates and the banks ... being their little helpers."" Zuma, who was removed as president last year over corruption allegations, is facing a judicial inquiry. He has agreed to cooperate but has dismissed the probe as prejudiced. Part of its brief is to investigate accusations that the Guptas - prominent businessmen brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh — influenced Zuma over political appointments and state contracts. Hain, a labour lord and former anti-Apartheid activist, called on the banks, global corporates and foreign governments to cooperate better so all those involved are brought to justice. In his submission he said a number of international banks helped the Guptas cloak the source of their funds - by allowing them to open and maintain bank accounts, even after allegations of their involvement in corruption became public, and also by allowing them to transfer illicit funds into these accounts. ""The warning signs were there and they did very little about it,"" he said of the banks, adding that when he had tried to question the banks after he had named them in parliament as complicity he ""found a great reluctance, citing ... client confidentiality, which is the excuse they hide behind.... The international banks, HSBC, Standard Chartered and Bank of Baroda are hiding behind this principle to conceal their complicity."" The role of global finance in facilitating corruption, fraud and money laundering has come under increasing scrutiny over the past decade, but the fight against financial crime is mostly dealt with by national authorities who often fail to cooperate effectively. Among his recommendations are to improve transparency around the beneficial owners of companies. He also proposes better programmes for auditing the due diligence conducted by banks to ensure that they are complying with anti-money laundering laws, and stiffer penalties for individuals and organisations that fail to do so.

"By Alan Baldwin BUDAPEST, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The Formula One calendar couldexpand to a record 22 races next season after the Catalangovernment approved a one-year extension for the Spanish GrandPrix at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya. Barcelona was out of contract after this year's race andconsidered one of those most at risk of dropping off theschedule. The Catalan authorities said in a statement that it hadauthorised the signing of an extension for 2020 with FormulaOne. ""The signing will guarantee the celebration of the 30thconsecutive edition of this event at the Barcelona-Catalunyacircuit,"" it added.

Mexico is also out of contract after this year's race andfacing a loss of government funding, but Formula One is keen toretain one of its best-attended events. A new deal for Mexico and extension for Barcelona wouldstretch the calendar to 22 rounds, providing the new races areready, but that also needs the approval of the competing teams. Haas principal Guenther Steiner told reporters at theHungarian Grand Prix that Formula One had asked about thepossibility and he was generally in favour. The Italian did express concern, however, that smaller teamslike his might have to pay more for their engines. The rulescurrently allow each driver three power units to last theseason.

"* Critics say Saudi Wahhabism spread intolerance in SriLanka * Wahhabi scholar arrested, govt eyes takeover of school * Ongoing probe has not found ties between bombers, SaudiArabia By Alexandra Ulmer and Omar Rajarathnam KATTANKUDY, Sri Lanka, July 5 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka ismoving to curtail Saudi Arabian influence, after somepoliticians and Buddhist monks blamed the spread of thekingdom's ultra-conservative Wahhabi school of Islam forplanting the seeds of militancy that culminated in deadly Easterbomb attacks. On April 21, nine Sri Lankans blew themselves up in churchesand luxury hotels, killing more than 250 people and shocking thecountry a decade after its civil war ended. Sri Lanka has since arrested a Wahhabi scholar and is poisedto take over a Saudi-funded school. The government also says itwill monitor previously unchecked money flows from donorsincluding prominent Saudi families to mosques on the IndianOcean island. ""Nobody will be able to just make donations now,"" saidMuslim cabinet minister Kabir Hashim, who has urged Muslimcommunities to look at how radical ideas could have spread. Hesaid the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairswould oversee donations. The outcry in Sri Lanka is the latest sign that Wahhabism,which critics deem a root cause of the jihadist threat, is underpressure internationally. Jihadist organizations, including Islamic State - whichclaimed responsibility for the Easter bombings - follow anextreme interpretation of Islam's Salafi branch, of whichWahhabism was the original strain. Saudi Arabia rejects the idea that Wahhabism is problematicand defends its record by pointing to the detention of thousandsof suspected militants. Riyadh in June sent back five SriLankans allegedly linked to the Easter attacks. Saudi diplomats in Colombo have expressed ""displeasure"" overbeing targeted during a recent meeting with PresidentMaithripala Sirisena, a Sri Lankan official told Reuters. Sirisena's office, as well as Saudi Arabia's Colombo embassyand the kingdom's communications office in Riyadh, did notrespond to requests for comment on the backlash against Saudiinfluence. MONKS' INFLUENCE That backlash has focused on one man in particular -Muhammad Hizbullah, a businessman and politician who was thegovernor of Sri Lanka's Eastern Province until he resigned inJune following protests by hardline Buddhist monks. The monks, who are influential on the island where 70percent of the population are Buddhists, and some members ofparliament say Hizbullah's links to Riyadh contributed to thespread of militancy in his native Kattankudy, a Muslim-majoritytown. Hizbullah's family helped build Saudi-financed mosques and aSaudi-funded higher education institute, Batticaloa Campus,which has not opened yet, in the Eastern Province. The mosque and school projects were led by the HiraFoundation, a non-profit owned by Hizbullah and his son Hiras. Its financial statements show income of some $31,000 between2014 and 2018, though Hizbullah told parliament Hira hadreceived $2 million from foreign donors. He did not respond to arequest from Reuters for further financial details. In an interview with Reuters at his home in the capital,Colombo, Hizbullah, 56, said most funds come from the Juffalis,a leading Saudi merchant family. Reuters also found two wiresfrom other Saudis but was not able to trace them. Hizbullah saidthey were pooled contributions from smaller donors. The Sheikh Ali Abdullah Al Juffali Foundation Charity wiredsome $24.5 million to Batticaloa Campus between 2016 and 2017,bank statements and loan agreements seen by Reuters show. Hizbullah warned the experience of the Juffalis, who he saidhave received hate mail, was spooking Saudi investors. He didnot identify any investors. Ongoing investigations have not shown that any Saudi moneyflowed to the plotters. And critics attribute moves againstSaudi influence to burgeoning Islamophobia, including mobattacks on Muslim properties in May. ""Not a single Saudi institution, charity or individual gaveeven one rupee to terrorists,"" Hizbullah said. The charity did not respond to calls or messages seekingcomment, and Reuters was unable to find alternative contactdetails for the Juffalis. The charity's website lists thefounders as Ali al-Juffali, a businessman and former member ofthe kingdom's consultative assembly who died in 2015, and hisfour sons. The charity says its objectives include supportingorphans and activities that promote religious tolerance. The Juffalis, who promised a total of $100 million toBatticaloa Campus, have halted loans over the school's uncertainfuture, Hizbullah said. Construction of the sprawling campus,designed in Islamic architectural style, has been paused, headded. Hira also connects mosques with donors. The modest Siharam Mosque, for example, was rebuilt in 2015thanks to some $56,000 from the Juffalis, according to a mosqueplaque and its ex-president M.Y. Adam, who said Hira received a10% commission. Hizbullah did not respond to questions aboutmosque funding. SCAPEGOAT? In the Reuters interview, Hizbullah also denied allegationsmade by some monks that he had links to the attacks, and noevidence has surfaced to support that claim. His critics, however, point to a 2015 photograph that showsMohamed Hashim Mohamed Zahran, who authorities say led the Aprilsuicide bombings and blew himself up at a Colombo hotel,grinning under his beard as he shakes Hizbullah's hand. Hizbullah said he was seeking support from Zahran, also aKattankudy native, for a parliamentary election. Back then,Hizbullah stressed, Zahran was just a charismatic preacher whocould deliver some 2,000 votes in the devout town of roughly50,000. His supporters - and even some opponents - say Hizbullah isa scapegoat. Ameer Ali Shihabdeen, an Eastern Province member ofparliament from a rival party, said Hizbullah was being targeteddespite a lack of evidence linking him to the attacks. Wahhabism spread to Sri Lanka's Eastern Province threedecades ago, when the area was convulsed by conflict betweenmostly Hindu Tamil separatists and the Buddhist-dominatedgovernment, according to local religious leaders andpoliticians. Muslim scholars received scholarships to study in SaudiArabia, while impoverished farmers escaped clashes by becomingdrivers or maids in the Middle East - often returning home withstricter Islamic practices, the sources said. Saudi-funded mosques mushroomed. Women ditched their sarisfor all-enveloping black abayas. Some Sri Lankan Sufis, whofollow a mystical form of Islam that Wahhabis considerheretical, said they began to be persecuted. Hizbullah's political career, which included stints inparliament, blossomed during this time. In Kattankudy, his nameadorns schools, a public hall and roads. Batticaloa Campus, the college funded by the Juffalis,initially planned to teach sharia, which some critics say limitswomen's rights. Hizbullah said sharia only meant the academicsubject of Islamic Studies, and that the discipline had beendropped from curriculum plans. Students would pay half standard tuition fees, whichHizbullah said was partly why this long-neglected area welcomesArab donors' deep pockets. A parliamentary committee last month called for authoritiesto take over Batticaloa Campus and compensate investors, citingincomplete documentation, possible violations of foreignexchange rules, and national security concerns. No decision has been announced yet, but a presidentialspokesman told Reuters that Sirisena, a Hizbullah ally who is onthe back foot ahead of presidential elections this year, alsofavours a takeover. WAHHABI SCHOLAR BEHIND BARS Some Kattankudy Sufis link the advent of Wahhabism to the1990 opening of the Saudi-financed Center for Islamic Guidance,which boasts a mosque, school, and library. Reuters was unableto trace Saudi donors, who had names common in the Middle East,thanked on a plaque at the centre. The centre ""brainwashed"" youth and distributed flyersdenouncing Sufism, according to H. M. Ameer, a communityspokesman who said his house was destroyed during anti-Sufiunrest in 2004. Persecution intensified with the rise of Zahran,the suspected Easter bombings ringleader, whose followersattacked Sufis with swords in 2017, Ameer added. Representatives of the centre did not respond to requestsfor comment about the Sufis' allegations. They previously toldReuters the centre practiced ""moderate Islam"". The centre's Riyadh-educated founder, Mohamed Aliyar, wasarrested in May for allegedly funding Zahran. The charge sheet, reviewed by Reuters, details his bankaccounts but does not provide evidence of wrongdoing. A policespokesman did not respond to requests for details. Aliyar's lawyer Abdul Uwais said he was a victim of paranoiaover Wahhabism. Two sources from Kattankudy's Muslim leadership said Zahranvoraciously read Wahhabi texts from Aliyar's centre, but thatthe men were not known to be close.(Reporting by Alexandra Ulmer and Omar Rajarathnam; Additionalreporting by Stephen Kalin in Riyadh, and Shihar Aneez and RangaSirilal in Colombo; Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing byMartin Howell and Alex Richardson)",INSIGHT-Wahhabism confronted: Sri Lanka curbs Saudi influence after bombings,"sri lanka is moving to curtail saudi arabian influence. critics say saudi wahhabism spread intolerance in srilanka. wahhabi scholar arrested, govt eyes takeover of school.","insight-after easter bombings , sri lanka moves to curb saudi arabian influence"

"* FTSE 100 down 0.3%, FTSE 250 up marginally * HSBC falls after profit miss * Cairn Energy biggest midcap faller (Adds company news items, updates share moves) By Muvija M and Shashwat Awasthi Oct 28 (Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 was dragged lower on Monday as bleak earnings update from lender HSBC sparked a selloff in financial stocks, while confusion around a likely delay to Brexit and a snap election also hurt sentiment. The bluechips were 0.3% lower by 0851 GMT, with more than half of the losses coming from HSBC, while the more domestically-focussed FTSE 250 inched slightly higher owing to gains in the pound. HSBC shares slumped 3.4% and were set for its worst day in eight months as its third-quarter profit missed market expectations and the bank dropped its 2020 earnings target amid ongoing macro-economic uncertainties. The update dragged a sub-index of banks lower by 2.1%. Financial companies have also had to adjust to a lower interest rate environment this year as central banks globally move to loosen monetary policies to cushion an impact from trade tensions. To that end, markets are also keeping a close eye on the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting this week for more support from the world's biggest central bank to aid a slowing economy. ""The external factors that worry the Federal Reserve seem to be abating currently and hence should have less impact on monetary policy trajectory and policymaker's decisions,"" Hussein Sayed, Chief market strategist at FXTM, said. In addition, UK firms face a lack of clarity at home as lawmakers and Prime Minister Boris Johnson feud over how to get Brexit done. Johnson has demanded a general election after being forced to request for another delay to the departure date, and sources have told Reuters that the European Union could agree to an extension until Jan.31 with an earlier departure also possible. News-related moves were scarce among midcaps, but for a 11.2% plunge in Cairn Energy after the oil and gas explorer abandoned an offshore well in Mexico. The update put the stock on course for its steepest one-day fall in nearly three years. Aston Martin, which has plunged nearly 80% from a 2018 debut, dropped 7% with a trader pointing to rating downgrade by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

"By Peter Rutherford Sept 10 (Reuters) - From apprentice stonemason working outof a cold shed in Stirling to celebrated flyhalf lighting up theplaying fields of France, the rise of Scotland's Finn Russell isthe stuff rugby dreams are made of. Since earning his first full-time contract at GlasgowWarriors in 2014 Russell has established himself as one of thefinest number 10's in the world, his talents persuading Frenchcracks Racing 92 to make him one of rugby's highest earners.

Off it, he is soaking up the Parisian lifestyle, learningthe language, broadening his horizons. ""I’m getting a lot more challenges here and I’m outside mycomfort zone a lot more,"" Russell told The Times. ""I’m going tobecome a better player, and the experiences I’ll get off thefield will be great for me as a person.” It is all a far cry from the three years he spent trainingto be a stonemason after leaving school -- building door frames,windowsills and walls. Safe to say, he will never take his newlife for granted. ""On rainy days it could be pretty miserable,"" he told localmedia of his previous trade. ""If I ever have a bad day at training, I think back to whatit was like working in that cold shed."" Russell has gone from strength to strength since swappingStirling Castle for the Sacre Coeur. Blessed with delightful invention and game-changing vision,Russell has added defensive steel and developed more of aninstinct for when to be cautious and when to be cavalier, a moremeasured gunslinger. None of that has dulled his instinctive genius with theball, however, his performance against England in the humdingerof a Six Nations test this year one highlight reel pass afteranother.

"* BHP exits U.S. shale, investors eye share buy-back * AMP slumps to near 15-year low * Benchmark set to eke out gains for week By Nikhil Nainan July 27 (Reuters) - Australian shares celebrated news on Friday that BHP, the world's biggest miner, had agreed to sell its troubled U.S. shale assets and promised to pass all proceeds to shareholders. Nearly a year after putting its U.S. shale assets up for sale and after months of market anticipation, BHP agreed to sell the shale oil and gas assets for $10.8 billion, with BP Plc picking up most of them. BHP shares were up 2.7 percent on Friday to their highest in more than two months, underscoring the deal's better-than-expected sale price and expectations of a lucrative share buy-back. ""I think it (the deal) has certainly increased the likelihood of a buy-back and buy-backs have certainly been something that's been driving markets globally,"" said Damien Rooney, director of equity sales at Argonaut. The deal ends a disastrous seven-year investment in the shale oil business, which triggered investors, led by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management, to press BHP to dump its shale business. The sale news helped drive the S&P/ASX 200 index up 0.9 percent to 6,298.4 by 0202 GMT. The benchmark ended slightly down on Thursday, but was set to eke out gains for the week. AMP Ltd fell as much as 4.9 percent to its lowest in nearly 15 years after the wealth manager said its underlying first-half profit would be down by A$490 million to A$500 million ($361.47 million-$368.85 million), from a year ago. The fall was due to a company-wide ""reset"" after a national inquiry found several instances of misconduct, AMP said, noting it was targeting a total fiscal 2018 dividend payout at the lower end of its 70-90 percent guidance range. ""(Lower dividend) That's probably why the shareholders who are pretty beaten up will be really concerned today,"" Argonaut's Rooney said. Financials, which account for well over a quarter of the benchmark, were nonetheless Friday's biggest gainers, with Australia and New Zealand Banking and National Australia Bank up 1.4 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. Treasury Wine Estates was the biggest drag on the main board, and is on track for a third straight session of losses after falling more than 4 percent. Earlier in the week, data showed that Australian wine exports to China surged 55 percent for the year ended June 30, which came after Treasury said it had faced customs delays at Chinese ports. Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index gained 0.3 percent, or 29.77 points to 8,963.41. Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Ltd and Fletcher Building supported the gains, rising 0.8 percent and 1 percent, respectively.

"By Vishwadha Chander (Reuters Health) - Smoke-free laws have helped Americans cut down on combustible cigarettes and helped protect nonsmokers from second-hand smoke, but not all United States regions have benefitted equally, a study suggests. As of July 2019, 25 of the 50 U.S. states had adopted comprehensive 100% smoke-free laws in workplaces, restaurants, and bars, and 11 more had laws covering at least one of these areas, the study authors report. ""The creation of smoke-free environments at workplaces and homes had a tremendously positive health impact... because it not only reduced exposure of non-smokers to secondhand smoke, but also created an environment that stimulates people to quit,"" senior study author Stanton Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at University of California, San Francisco, told Reuters Health by phone. Many states, however, do not have strong laws, and people in those states are disproportionately burdened by tobacco use, he and his colleagues wrote October 2 online in the American Journal of Public Health. For their new study, Glantz and colleagues reviewed dozens of previous studies of combustible cigarette smoking and smoke-free legislation, and data from the Centers for Disease Control, the American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation, the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Previous research found no-smoking laws cut non-smokers' exposure to secondhand smoke from 52.5% to 25.5%. The laws were also associated with reductions in hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and lower smoking rates among adolescents. States with no-smoking laws also had more support services to help smokers quit. ""These laws have changed the culture of smoking and its social acceptability,"" said Dr. Vaughan Rees, a lecturer on social and behavioral sciences, and director of the Center for Global Tobacco Control at Harvard Chan School of Public Health, Boston. Rees, who was not part of the study, said smoking is less visible, and adults no longer model their smoking to younger people. ""However, the study shows smoke-free policies are not applied in an equitable way,"" Rees told Reuters Health in a phone interview. Between 2000-2009, U.S. Asians and Hispanics benefitted most from smoke-free laws, as many of them lived where these laws were passed, the research team found. Non-Hispanic African Americans received the least protection from these laws, as many of them live in the tobacco-growing states of the south, or in the mid-west, where fewer smoke-free laws exist. ""Historically, tobacco was a powerful political force in these places,"" said Glantz. This began to change in 2004, after manufacturers backed a move to end a price support program for tobacco farmers. The farmers started growing other crops and no longer opposed tobacco control policies, the authors write. ""Health groups are doing better at getting tobacco control laws passed in these regions now,"" Glantz said. ""They haven't caught up with the rest of the country, but things are moving there."" At the individual level, people are generally supportive of smoke-free homes and apartments, the authors found from their analysis. The authors believe smoke-free policies should be extended to homeless shelters and sites serving low-income populations. The way forward, said Glantz, is a ""matter of people getting organized and putting pressure on legislators and governors"" to bring in smoke-free rules. He and his colleagues conclude, ""Expanding the reach of comprehensive smoke-free laws and smoking cessation services not only will facilitate the decline in smoking prevalence among subpopulations disproportionately burdened by tobacco use but will reduce exposure to second-hand smoke and further improve health outcomes in the United States.""

"By P.J. Huffstutter and Michael Hirtzer CHICAGO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Farmers from North Dakota toIowa buckled down for some of the coldest weather in ageneration on Wednesday, throwing extra rations to pigs orbuilding igloos for chickens before hunkering down for a day ofsub-zero temperatures and bone-chilling winds. Some, like Kurt Line in Indiana, joked about the forecast.Line said he looked forward to working on his tax returns,something he usually puts off, rather than braving the cold toload corn for a local processing plant. But temperatures expected to plunge in some areas as low asminus 40 degrees, the point at which Fahrenheit and Celsiusconverge, are no laughing matter for an industry dependent onthe elements. The brutal chill was caused by the polar vortex, amass of freezing air that normally spins around the North Polebut has made its way south to the United States. Cattle ranchers Joey Myers and her fiancé, Scott Bailey, inMinot, North Dakota, were brewing coffee with plans to stay upall night as long as the cold lasted to check on their animals. “We’ll be doing the same tonight, tomorrow night and thenight after that,” said Myers, who added the couple werebreaking out their ski masks and ski goggles to protect theirfaces from the cold. They feared the minus 18-degree F ( minus 28-C) temperatureswith wind chills of minus 50 degrees F ( minus 45 C) could causetheir pregnant cows to give birth early. Their heated barn isnot big enough to house every animal, so they must keep watchfor newborn calves to prevent fatalities. Ron Prestage, president of one of Iowa's biggest hogproducers, Prestage Farms, said his company had been stocking upon feed to last at least until Friday, and was making sureheaters and water lines were running at hog barns. ""When it gets cold, they eat more,"" he said in a phoneinterview. So we just have to make sure we plan ahead.” “As cold as it’s going to be, water lines are a criticalfactor,” he added. Also in Iowa, Deanna Brennecke said she knew the cold wascoming days before the local TV weather reports: Her cattle hadbeen eating far more feed and putting on weight to help keepthemselves warm as the temperatures plummeted. “They were meeting us at the gate, and filling themselvesfull, and we just knew,” said Brennecke, who runs her family’scow-calf farm and raises goats with her husband in DecaturCounty. VASELINE AND CHICKEN SKIN The cold weather was also a concern for small-scale farmers. In Wisconsin, where temperatures were heading toward minus30 degrees F ( minus 34 C), dairy farmer Amber McComish and herfamily stocked up on extra fuel for the generator for theirmilking barn, tucked the baby calves into a heated room and madesure all the animals had food and water. Backyard chicken owners in the Midwest flocked online foradvice on how to protect their birds, with some on the chatforum at BackyardChickens.com asking if they should add aheating pad for their poultry to stand on. Others suggested putting extra tarps around the coops tokeep chickens dry and coating exposed chicken skin withpetroleum jelly to ward off frostbite. In Chicago, Lynn Ankney and her family have beendouble-checking their backyard coop, making sure there are nodrafts around their Rhode Island Red and Black Australorp hens –and using snow that accumulated in recent days to build an iglooaround their coop for extra insulation. “We’re keeping a close eye on them,” said Ankney.(Reporting by P.J.

Franck Ribery impressed on his first start for the hosts asthey created the better chances, but a lack of clinicalfinishing from Vincenzo Montella's men helped Juve escape with apoint. ""I am proud, because the team had two and a half games at agreat level so far this season against some very toughopposition, so that means we can fight it out with anyone,""Montella told Sky Sport Italia. ""Unfortunately, when we have 10-15 shots on goal and don'tscore, that is disappointing.

"By Sonia Elks LONDON, March 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A leading British soap opera storyline about a young gay footballer could help challenge homophobia in sport and encourage players to feel more comfortable in their sexuality, LGBT+ campaigners said on Tuesday. The ""Coronation Street"" drama watched by millions follows the story of rising sports star James Bailey, played by actor Nathan Graham, who faces speculation on social media about his sexuality and must decide whether to go public. ""A story about a black, gay footballer will probably challenge stereotypes that people have about people of colour and being LGBT,"" said Robbie de Santos, director of sport at LGBT+ rights charity Stonewall. ""There are still many people in the sport community who just don't think there are LGBT+ people in the stadiums with them or taking part in Sunday kickabouts with them."" Although attitudes towards LGBT+ people have warmed greatly in Britain over recent decades, homophobia remains a persistent issue within sport - and particularly football. Homophobic chants have been heard in stadiums across Europe and top male players are reportedly unwilling to come out as gay amid concerns over hostility. Top English clubs are trying to stamp out gay abuse by encouraging fans to report it and with campaigns involving captains wearing rainbow armbands. In a recent episode of the show, Bailey comes out to his family but struggles to keep the information private when reporters spot the rumour posted online. Actor Graham said he hoped the plotline would ""start a conversation"" among viewers. ""Hopefully it will educate people that discrimination is discrimination no matter what it is; race, religion, sexuality,"" he said in an interview shared by the show's team."" ""Coronation Street"" has been running since 1960 and shows working-class communities in the fictional northern English town of Weatherfield. (Reporting by Sonia Elks @soniaelks; Editing by Tom Finn.

"(Repeats to additional subscribers) By Ernest Scheyder May 14 (Reuters) - Livent Corp aims to derive morethan half of its lithium sales from the electric vehicleindustry by next year, a shift for a company that historicallyhas supplied the white metal for use in greases and otherindustrial products, its chief executive said Tuesday in aninterview. Philadelphia-based Livent has struggled in recent months toretain some customers and offset gyrations in the price oflithium it produces. While the company's lithium is used inTesla Inc vehicles, Livent has not expanded into theautomotive space as rapidly as some peers have. ""Our customers are changing,"" Chief Executive Paul Gravestold Reuters. ""The auto supply chain is an increasingly criticalarea for us."" Livent last week cut its full-year profit and revenueforecasts and also said two senior executives would exit. Thecompany's stock has since dropped 30 percent since the forecastcut, closing Tuesday at $7.70 per share. ""There's no doubt this is a transitionary year,"" saidGraves, who joined chemical maker FMC Corp in 2012before it spun off Livent last fall. Livent has focused its business on one specific type of thewhite metal, hydroxide, which has drawn weak demand in recentmonths due in part to uncertainty around China's electricvehicle subsidies. Graves said he regrets that Livent moved so quickly to focuson hydroxide, preferring instead that the company focused onboth hydroxide and carbonate, another main type of the metal. ""There's no doubt the shift to hydroxide is happening acrossthe industry... but it would have been nice to be a little morediversified with more carbonate in the mix,"" he said. NO PLANS TO SELL Graves said that in addition to the executive departuresannounced last week, two or three other junior staff memberswill leave, but no mass layoff is planned. Livent in the next few years plans to hire sales staff inSouth Korea, China and Japan, part of a strategy to take agreater share of the battery market, he said. The company has no desire to sell itself and does not seeany appealing buyout opportunities, Graves added.

"By Ian Ransom MELBOURNE, March 17 (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton experiencedfrustration for a third successive year at the season-openingAustralian Grand Prix on Sunday, as a poor start and an earlypitstop condemned the Formula One champion to another runnerupfinish. Briton Hamilton claimed a record-extending eighth poleposition at Albert Park on Saturday but ended up a distantsecond to his resurgent team mate Valtteri Bottas, who got thejump on him at the start and burned away. Hamilton was called in to pit early and change to mediumcompound tyres, straight after Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel didthe same. Bottas, meanwhile, stayed out on his soft tyres and extendedhis lead. With Red Bull's third-placed Max Verstappen a menacingpresence behind him, Hamilton complained on the team radio thathe was worried his tyres would not last and battled handlingissues late on.

"By Heather Somerville and Paul Lienert April 12 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp leaderMasayoshi Son has much bigger ambitions for transportation thansimply seeing his investment in Uber Technologies Inc turn intomore than $13 billion when the company goes public next month. The Japanese entrepreneur is placing a $60 billion bet inmore than 40 companies in a bid to steer the $3 trillion globalautomotive industry now dominated by vehicles people own anddrive to a spectrum of transportation services available at thetouch of a smartphone app. Those services range from ridehailing and car sharing to delivery robots and self-drivingvehicles. The extent of those investments, based on a Reuters analysisof publicly available data and interviews with a dozen sourcesfamiliar with SoftBank's investment strategy, has not previouslybeen reported. They show how Son has emerged as one of the powerplayers trying to influence how people and goods move about theworld in the coming decades. For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2UQXn4F Key partners in Son's quest are Uber, the U.S. ride servicesleader, and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. Uber's planned initial public stock offering in May isexpected to value the company at $90 billion to $100 billion,representing a potential windfall to SoftBank, which put $8billion into Uber for a 15 percent stake in January 2018. Therising value of that investment will further supercharge Son’sgrowing clout in the sector, and eventually provide him withadditional capital to invest in mobility. Closer to home, Toyota approached Son more than a year agoabout a partnership, and SoftBank in February 2018 signed amemorandum of understanding with the automaker to consider howthey might jointly develop mobility services, according tosources familiar with the document. The agreement was followedby the launch of a joint venture dubbed Monet Technologies,designed to set up automated mobility services. SoftBank and Toyota are also in talks to co-lead a $1billion investment in Uber's self-driving unit, Reuters reportedin March. While the deal is close to beingfinalized, discussions remain ongoing around issues such as howmuch of the unit SoftBank would control, sources told Reuters. Toyota declined to comment for this story. In an interview with Reuters, SoftBank Group Chief OperatingOfficer Marcelo Claure said that the two Japanese companies""have a lot sessions in which we think and we try to redefinethe future of mobility."" Central to those sessions are discussions about how Toyotaand SoftBank can collaborate to bring autonomous vehicles toJapan, he said. Son has been working since 2014 to weave together a tapestryof diverse transportation bets. His deep portfolio ofinvestments range literally from A to Z: From Arm, a Britishsemiconductor maker that Son acquired in 2016 for $32 billion,to Zume Pizza, a Silicon Valley startup that aims to automatepizza delivery and raised $375 million last year from SoftBank.For a FACTBOX, click A FAMILY AFFAIR SoftBank has used at least five investment vehicles,including the $100 billion Vision Fund, from which to make itsmobility investments, public records show. Its deep pockets,aggressive investing tactics and sweeping vision of the futureof transportation give SoftBank and its leader Son an outsizedinfluence in shaping the entire industry. The Vision Fund has more than 30 investment professionalswho work to promote cooperation and integration among theportfolio companies, which they refer to as a ""family."" ""We can create this web where companies talk to each otherand they help each other because they are part of the samefamily and they do joint ventures and they do jointinvestments,"" Claure said. SoftBank and its affiliates have focused some of theirbiggest investments on self-driving firm Cruise, a unit of GM,and four global ride-services giants — Uber, Didi Chuxing, Olaand Grab. SoftBank is the largest shareholder in the fourride-services companies and the largest outside shareholder inCruise. Son ""is the true emperor of future mobility,"" said Tom DeVleesschauwer, senior director of long-term planning andsustainability at IHS Automotive. To help implement his vision, Son also allied with GeneralMotors Co and Honda Motor Co, each of which isinvesting heavily in self-driving vehicles and ride services. Son laid out his future of transportation vision in anOctober press conference alongside Toyota, where he talkedabout building a ""cluster"" of leading mobility companies indifferent sectors, which ""can collaborate with each other."" Toyota a year ago introduced e-Palette, an electric shuttledesigned for self-driving ride and delivery services, andquickly signed up Uber and Didi as development partners. Thee-Palette is also the centerpiece of Monet Technologies, whichadded Honda as a minority partner in March. All are tied back toSoftBank. That collaboration is expected to enable some SoftBankcompanies to become ""superapps,"" or applications where customersgo for a range of services, such as transportation, shopping andpayments. Such companies can be much more lucrative than thosethat offer just one core business or service. But the fact that many of SoftBank's companies are rivalscan complicate the investor's ambitions. Uber and Ola, theIndian ride-hailing company, remain fierce competitors and arenever in the same room when SoftBank discusses ride-hailingstrategies, Claure said. Traditionally in venture capital, funds do not invest indirect competitors. ""There are tremendous synergies, but on the other hand thereis significant risk of tremendous conflicts of interest,"" saidPaul Asel, managing partner at NGP Capital and a longtimemobility investor. There are limits to the investor's influence, however. Forexample, SoftBank encouraged Cruise to acquire or take a stakein self-driving startup Nuro, but talks between the companiesnever led to a deal, according to two sources with knowledge ofthe matter. So SoftBank made its own, $940 million investment in Nuro. HUNTING BIG GAME In his five-year transportation push, Son's stakes in rideservices startups now look like bargains. In late 2014, SoftBankjoined Alibaba, China's internet giant in whichSoftBank also has a stake, in a $600 million funding round inKuaidi Dache, the forerunner of China's Didi. That investment has grown to more than $11 billion in Didi,in which SoftBank now holds more than 20 percent. SoftBank's partnerships with major automakers are alsoproving to be a boon to transportation startups. Toyota investedin Uber in 2016, then boosted its stake seven months afterSoftBank's investment. Honda followed SoftBank with aninvestment into Grab, and last year committed $2.75 billion toCruise's self-driving project, aiding SoftBank's ambitions. But the SoftBank portfolio is not without risks,particularly for companies dependent on the Japanese firm tosustain them financially for years to come. SoftBank facesfinancial pressures, including an obligation to pay an annual 7percent dividend on a portion of the invested capital and hasburnt through the majority of the Vision Fund. And it is compelled by a new U.S. law cracking down onforeign investment in technology to submit many of its mobilityinvestments to a government regulatory agency for approval.Should that regulatory group block a deal, it could becatastrophic to a startup. But there is some safety for Son given the size of hisportfolio. ""He's shooting for big game,"" Roger Lanctot, globalautomotive practice director at Strategy Analytics, said of Son.""He only needs to bag one or two and he will do just fine.""

"By Onke Ngcuka JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Reuters) - South African financialservices group Alexander Forbes is looking for a buyerto acquire its insurance businesses, it said on Tuesday, part ofa strategic shake-up aimed at refocusing the group as a wealthand pension funds manager. Alexander Forbes's decision to exit the business comes fourmonths after Dawie de Villiers started work as chief executivein place of Andrew Darfoor who had been fired two months before. De Villiers has drawn up a refreshed strategy which aims tobuild a capital-light organisation in order to take advantage ofthe company's leading market position in the South Africanretirement fund administration industry.

"By Jonathan Stempel New York, May 29 (Reuters) - A Manhattan federal judge hasordered seven U.S. stock exchanges to face proposed class-actionclaims that they defrauded ordinary investors by quietlyenabling high-frequency traders to trade faster and at betterprices. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman on Tuesday said claimsagainst BATS Global Markets, Nasdaq, the New York StockExchange and other defendants had ""nudged themselves across theline from conceivable to plausible"" and should not be dismissed. Furman had dismissed the claims in 2015, saying theexchanges were absolutely immune from liability, but a federalappeals court overturned that finding in December 2017. The exchanges were accused of violating federal securitieslaw by developing and selling high-priced services to provideadvantages to favored high-frequency trading customers, whileconcealing these services from ordinary investors. High-frequency traders were allegedly afforded access toenhanced data feeds, a greater ability to process complexorders, and permission to locate their servers near theexchanges' own servers so trading signals would be sent faster. Investors claimed they lost money as a result of theexchanges' manipulative conduct.

"(Adds prime minister role) KHARTOUM, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Abdullah Hamduk, named as finance minister in Sudan's new administration, has formally declined the appointment, state news agency SUNA reported on Saturday. Hamduk was the former executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir instead tasked Prime Minister Moataz Moussa Abdullah with managing the affairs of the finance ministry, SUNA said later on Saturday. Bashir named the new prime minister this week and said the number of ministers in a leaner government would be slashed by a third to cut government spending as the economy grapples with soaring inflation and an acute hard currency shortage. Khartoum has been trying to slash expenditures as it grapples with inflation that hit about 64 percent year-on-year in July and a hard currency shortage that has given way to intermittent shortages in staples like fuel and bread. Bashir's ruling party said last month that it plans to nominate the longtime ruler for re-election in 2020, a move that requires amending the constitution.

"By Davide Barbuscia, Alex Lawler and Marwa Rashad DUBAI/LONDON/RIYADH, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is unlikely to list its oil giant Aramco this year after attacks earlier this month on oil facilities, two sources with direct knowledge of the company's thinking said. The initial public offering (IPO) of Aramco – the world's largest oil company – is the pillar of Saudi reforms aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil by attracting foreign capital. Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources declined to be identified because the information is not public. The deal, which was delayed last year, was expected to take place as early as November, sources had said, for an offering of 1% of the company on the Saudi bourse, the first step of a targeted 5% sale that could potentially raise $100 billion. Aramco's chairman, Yassir al-Rumayyan, said last week following the attacks, which initially halved the crude output of the world's top oil exporter, that it would be ready for the IPO within one year.

"(Repeats item that first ran on Wednesday) * Fresh elections could mark positive surprise * Spark unwind of bearish bond bets * Tensions with ruling coalition high By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - With markets braced for a lengthy standoff between Rome and Brussels over Italy's 2019 spending plans, investors see little that could change their gloomy view of Italian bonds other than a snap election that alters the makeup of the government. Because markets are already positioned for further weakness in Italian debt - with a huge outstanding short position in government bond futures built up over the summer - prices are now most vulnerable to a positive surprise. With neither the European Union nor Rome minded to change tack, the stability of Italy's ruling coalition has become one of the few variables discussed by asset managers as a game changer. A snap election would raise the prospect of a centre-right coalition, seen as potentially more functional than the current government. The tensions within the coalition of the far-right League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement were highlighted last week by it holding and winning a no-confidence vote, and also by its internal wrangling over removing time limits on trials. Snap elections, seen as unlikely until at least after European Union parliamentary elections in May, remain a risk that could take investors by surprise. Since the general election this March, Matteo Salvini's League has gained ground in opinion polls, climbing to peaks above 30 percent while 5-Star's support has faded. ""If Italy were to call a snap election, even with polls where they are at the moment, this would be relatively positive for Italian assets because most of League's policies are budget friendly,"" said David Zahn, head of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton. ""They want to cut taxes but they don't have big spending plans like 5-Star and would probably partner with somebody else with a similar thought process,"" he said. ""From that perspective, you could see Italian bonds do relatively well on fresh elections."" That's significant because market pricing suggests investors largely expect bad news on Italy. A surge in the number of outstanding contracts in Italian government bond futures or open interest in recent weeks is one sign that markets are heavily positioned for more bond weakness. That also means a development such as elections or a compromise on the budget forces a quick unwind of those bearish bets. In May, a market positioned for further Italian bond gains had to adjust quickly as the formation of the League/5-Star coalition sparked fears about spendthrift policies. Hopes for a breakthrough on the 2019 budget were dashed this week, however, with Rome sticking to its growth and deficit plans, setting the stage for a showdown with the EU. Guggenheim Partners Global Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, a veteran investor who helped Italy restructure its debt after the European currency crises of 1992 and 1993, told Reuters there is an above-50 percent chance of Italy pulling out of the euro or another ""catastrophic"" outcome. INSTABILITY Italy has had over 60 governments since the end of World War Two, and political instability is part of the norm for investors there. Recent developments suggest the threat of the new government falling remains alive. Rome last week called and won a confidence vote to tackle dissent within 5-Star over a contested security decree. A separate dispute over removing time limits on trials was resolved after 5-Star's Luigi Di Maio warned that the coalition would collapse if no agreement was reached. Federico Santi at Eurasia Group said the collapse of the coalition and snap elections are unlikely any time soon as both parties are reluctant to take that risk. ""However, the stumble over the decree is the first sign the coalition is fraying at the edges, and confirms our view that the government is unlikely to last a full term,"" he said in a note. Georg Schuh, Chief Investment Officer for EMEA at DWS, told Reuters on Tuesday that if next May's European parliament elections show support for populists, it is probable that Italy could call new elections. ""Then, if we have a coalition of the League and (conservative) Forza Italia, then this government could be a little bit more stable and less polarized,"" he said. Italy's bond market is the worst-performing major euro zone debt market so far this year, with negative returns on 10-year bonds of 9.5 percent. Its yield gap over German bonds is over 310 basis points , up from 125 bps just before May's bond market rout, reflecting the extent of bearish sentiment on Italy. A weak economy and the prospect of an end to European Central Bank stimulus are not helping. UBP portfolio manager Mohammed Kazmi said most investors had taken a positive view going into the March Italian election and that was likely to be the case again in the event of a new vote. ""But to get to that stage, for new elections to be called, there is likely to be a lot of volatility first,"" he said.

" (Adds report details, comments from Unica, tables)     By Marcelo Teixeira     SAO PAULO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Brazil's center-south sugar output fell to only 1.28 million tonnes in the second half of September as rains reduced crushing activity and mills continued to allocate minimum amounts of cane to sugar production, industry group Unica said on Wednesday.     Production of the sweetener was 55 percent lower than seen in the same period a year earlier, while cane crushing fell 31 percent to 27.6 million tonnes.     Unica said mills allocated only 33.08 percent of the cane to produce sugar, one of the lowest industrial mixes levels ever, earmarking all the rest to the production of ethanol as the biofuel currently gives them better financial returns.     Ethanol production late in September, at 1.63 million tonnes, also fell from the previous two-week period and compared to the same period last year, although less than the drop seen for sugar. (See tables below)     ""The expansion on ethanol production, considering the changes in the industrial mix at mills, will result in a cut of sugar supplies this season of 9 million tonnes compared to the last crop,"" said Antonio de Padua Rodrigues, Unica's technical director.     He also said that at least five mills in the center-south have already finished cane crushing for the year, an unusual development since companies usually process the crop until later in the year.     Unica projects that the other 32 mills will finish activities during the second half of October, as the season is cut short due to a quick harvesting pace earlier in the year and a smaller crop due to dryer-than-normal weather and aging cane fields.     Agricultural yields for September came in at 64 tonnes per  hectare, 10.5 percent less than seen a year earlier.

"LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Central banks holding sterling as part of their forex reserves could sell more than 100 billion pounds ($127.53 billion) should Britain crash out of the European Union without a trade deal, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch study showed on Tuesday. The prospect of a no-deal Brexit is becoming increasingly feasible in the eyes of investors who are hedging against the risk of the currency tanking if Britain is left isolated from the EU, its largest trading partner. Central bank selling could be a major catalyst for a significant sterling downturn should Britain prove unable to secure a deal before next March, BAML told clients, noting that global sterling reserves currently amount to nearly $500 billion. While International Monetary Fund data shows sterling comprising 4.5 percent of total central bank reserves, BAML said sterling's average share of global reserves since 1995 was 3.6 percent. A 1 percent decline in sterling reserves equates to 100 billion pounds of selling, it calculates. ""In a scenario that central banks adjust their sterling holdings back to the long-term average (3.6 percent), this suggests that they could sell upwards of 100 billion pounds in sterling reserves on a no-deal scenario, all else being equal,"" the note said. BAML still expects a ""soft"" Brexit in which Britain retains customs access to the EU, and said reserve managers would likely await confirmation of a no-deal scenario before making a portfolio shift. ""This [no-deal Brexit] is not our base case, but we think central bank flows are an important source of flow which could determine whether sterling succumbs to a more protracted current account crisis,"" the bank added.

"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: https://reut.rs/2RBNEzB By John Kemp LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - Oil traders have become increasingly sceptical about whether the global oil supply deal finalised on Sunday will be enough to prevent a large accumulation of excess petroleum for the rest of this year. Brent’s calendar spread for the fourth quarter of 2020 has widened to a contango of almost $2.50 a barrel in trading today, up from only $1.05 on April 3, when hopes for the forthcoming agreement were running high. Calendar spreads, rather than spot prices, generally provide the best insight into the expected balance between production and consumption, though the two are loosely related (https://reut.rs/2RBNEzB). Contango, where spot prices trade below futures prices, is usually associated with high and rising petroleum inventories. Conversely, backwardation - the opposite of contango - is typically associated with low and falling inventories. Brent’s calendar spread collapsed into deep contango in the first quarter as the coronavirus epidemic threatened economies and a volume war erupted between Saudi Arabia and Russia until they were persuaded to rethink as major economies went into lockdown. The prospect of the deal on record production cuts helped to narrow the contango in early April, but it has flared again as traders have digested the details of the agreement. The continuing pressure on Brent spreads suggests many oil traders now expect a long and deep recession that will reduce oil consumption significantly and raise inventories for an extended period. PRODUCTION PROGRAMME The enlarged OPEC+ group of oil exporters, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, has agreed to cut production in May and June by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) from reference levels. Thereafter, OPEC+ will continue with tapered reductions of 7.7 million bpd for six months to the end of 2020 and 5.8 million bpd for a further 16 months until the end of April 2022. Russia and Saudi Arabia have agreed to implement their cuts from the same reference level of 11 million bpd (“The 10th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting concludes”, OPEC, April 12). OPEC+ is also assuming there will be additional price-driven output declines worldwide, principally from the United States, as low prices force shale producers to scale back activity. U.S. crude oil output is forecast to decline by about 1.75 million bpd between March and October, acording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, April 7). CONSUMPTION SLUMP Production cuts are intended to help to offset the fall in consumption as a result of the pandemic and lockdowns, which the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates will cut oil use by an average of 9.3 million bpd in 2020. “The measures announced by OPEC+ and the G20 countries won’t rebalance the market immediately,” the IEA warned on Wednesday, adding that it should provide support over time (“Oil Market Report”, IEA, April 15). Global petroleum consumption is forecast to decline by 29 million bpd year on year in April and still be down by 26 million bpd in May and 15 million bpd in June. “But by lowering the peak of the supply overhang and flattening the curve of the build-up in stocks, they help a complex system absorb the worst of this crisis,” the IEA concluded. The long-term production profile agreed by OPEC+ aims to limit, though not eliminate, overproduction in the next few months to limit the build up of excess stocks, then hold production below consumption later in 2020 and through 2021 into early 2022 to draw down the excess stocks accumulated this year. MARKET ALLOCATION The OPEC+ deal's proposed programme is a hugely ambitious attempt to curtail global production to manage an equally unprecedented slump in consumption. In effect, the it is the first attempt to allocate incremental oil consumption between the world’s three largest producers. Russia and Saudi Arabia are explicitly involved, with specified reference levels of output, while the United States has been enlisted as an unnamed silent partner. For much of the past decade the United States has captured all or almost all of the incremental growth in global oil consumption, with the exception of three years of low prices over 2015 to 2017. The agreement assumes prices will remain low enough throughout the programme to limit any resurgence in U.S. output at the expense of the other two major partners. LINGERING DOWNTURN The deal’s success depends on a relatively early phased exit from current lockdowns and rapid resumption of near-normal business activity as well as passenger and freight transportation. The strategy relies on strict lockdowns to bring the epidemic under control quickly, followed by an exit strategy based on ramped up coronavirus testing and targeted isolation, quarantine and containment measures. It further assumes that lockdowns can be lifted substantially without risking a second wave of infections and deaths later in the year. More fundamentally, like other policy responses to the pandemic, the OPEC+ strategy relies on the economy being like a lightbulb that can be switched off and on quickly, with no lasting impact. As part of this effort, unprecedented fiscal and monetary intervention aims to protect economic relationships during the lockdowns so they can later resume as near to normal as possible. But nothing in the economic history of the 20th and 21st centuries suggests this is remotely plausible. Recessions leave lasting scars on the economy. The deeper and longer the downturn, the longer the after-effects linger. In reality, many smaller and leveraged businesses are likely to fail because they do not have the financial reserves to ride out an extended stoppage. Even with massive fiscal and monetary intervention, a large percentage of households and businesses will suffer a significant loss of income and output. Some of the production and income lost during the recesssion will be permanent, or at least linger for several more years, much as the impact of the 2008/09 financial crisis was evident on incomes and output for years. If the economy cannot be jump-started quickly, and at close to pre-crisis levels, oil inventories will rise even further, requiring even deeper and longer production cuts. The persistent weakness of futures prices for oil delivered towards the end of 2020 and 2021 indicates that many traders now see this as the most likely outcome.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong/Jakarta-April 03: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Indonesia-based port operator PT Pelabuhan Indonesia II (Persero)'s (Pelindo II) Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'. The Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. RATING RATIONALE The coronavirus pandemic and government containment measures worldwide have created an uncertain global environment for sea ports in the near term. Fitch's ratings are forward-looking, and we will monitor pandemic-related developments in the sector for severity and duration, and incorporate revised base- and rating-case qualitative and quantitative inputs based on our expectations for performance and assessment of key risks. The virus outbreak could result in weaker domestic consumption and export demand for Indonesia. The shutdown of factories in China, Indonesia's major trading partner, has inevitably hurt Indonesian ports' container throughput in 1Q20. Container throughput at Tanjung Priok, Pelindo II's largest port, declined 5% yoy in the first two months of 2020, mainly due to the reduced container volume to and from China. We expect the impact on throughput to increase in severity in 2Q20 with the global spread of the coronavirus. However, cargo mobility remains uninterrupted by government lockdowns, which only restrict people's movements, to ensure efficient logistics for critical goods including food and medical supplies. In addition, Pelindo II generates about 30% of its revenue from fixed rental income from its joint ventures (JV), which we believe provides a buffer against throughput volatility. Pelindo II's debt comprises mainly the two US dollar bonds due 2025 and 2045, and it has no near-term refinancing needs. The terminal operations rely on contractual labor and, therefore, operating expenses could fall in light of the reduced throughput. Its capex budget is mainly expansionary and we see timing flexibility in executing its plans. The rating considers Pelindo II's market-leading position in Indonesia's container port industry, the strategic location of its flagship Tanjung Priok port as well as the long-term maturity of its concessions, which ensures visibility of group cash-flow generation. Pelindo II also benefits from stable rental income from its JVs under a landlord-tenant model, despite moderate flexibility in modifying tariffs. Pelindo II's leverage will average 3.1x over the five-year forecast period of 2019-2023 under Fitch's rating case. We see Pelindo II's rating as commensurate with a 'bbb' underlying rating. Pelindo II's IDR reflects the company's underlying rating and does not include any support from its sole shareholder, the government of Indonesia (BBB/Stable). Government-Related Entity Assessment We assess Pelindo II's linkages with the Indonesian government under our Government-Related Entities Rating Criteria. The criteria consider the strength of linkages between Pelindo II and the government as well as the government's incentive to provide support to the company. Strength of Linkages: Fitch sees Pelindo II's status, ownership and control by the sovereign as 'Strong'. The state fully owns the company and appoints its commissioners and board. It also controls its investment plans and capex decisions. We also assess the support record and expectations of state support to Pelindo II as 'Strong'. There is no record of the government providing tangible support to the company, as Pelindo II has a sound financial profile. However, we expect the company to receive government support, if needed, due to its important role in the country's economic development. State's Incentive to Support: Fitch sees the socio-political implications of a default by Pelindo II as 'Moderate'. A default would damage the government's reputation, but we do not believe it would cause a severe disruption to Indonesia's trade activity, as port infrastructure would remain intact and could be operated by other entities. Our assessment of the financial implications of a default by Pelindo II is 'Strong', as the company is regarded as one of Indonesia's key state-owned entities and a default would hamper investor confidence in the sovereign and other state-owned entities. Strength of Linkage - status, ownership and control: Strong - support record and expectations: Strong State's Incentive to Support - socio-political implications of a default: Moderate - financial implications of a default: Strong KEY RATING DRIVERS See our rating action commentary ""Fitch Affirms Indonesia's Pelindo II at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable"" (https://www.fitchratings.com/research/infrastructure-project-finance/fitch-affi rms-indonesia-pelindo-ii-at-bbb-outlook-stable-11-07-2019), published 11 July 2019, for the key rating driver assessment and analysis. PEER GROUP PT Pelabuhan Indonesia III (Persero) (Pelindo III, BBB-/Stable; SCP: bb+) is Pelindo II's closest peer. Pelindo II has Indonesia's largest container market share, followed by Pelindo III. Pelindo II also benefits from stable rental income from its JVs and is thus better placed than Pelindo III. Both companies are undertaking heavy expansion plans to support the development of Indonesia's maritime industry, but Pelindo II has lower average leverage than Pelindo III over the forecast period under Fitch's rating case, and a stronger volume-risk assessment compared with a midrange assessment for Pelindo III. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action: - Weak financial performance due to lower volume, credit erosion of terminal operators that results in rental payment delinquencies, increased costs or additional indebtedness for distributions leading to a projected five-year average Fitch-adjusted net debt/EBITDAR above 4.0x under Fitch's rating case - Downgrade of Indonesia's sovereign rating - Change in business profile, for instance, a loss of fixed rental income, leading to more volatile revenue Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action: - Sustained improvement of Fitch-adjusted net debt/EBITDAR below 3.0x under Fitch's rating case over five years - Upgrade of Indonesia's sovereign rating combined with strengthening linkages with the government Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario International scale credit ratings of Public Finance issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of three notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS The Fitch base case (FBC) forecasts container throughput to decline by 5% in 2020 and subsequently increase in line with GDP. We also expect throughput to be boosted by the commissioning of the NPCT2/3 terminals and Kijing Port. We forecast throughput to rise at 3% CAGR between 2018 and 2023. We assume container tariffs will track Indonesian inflation. We assume cash operating expenses will increase by 6% CAGR over the same period. Our revised FBC generates an average adjusted net debt/EBITDAR average of 2.7x over the five-year forecast period of 2019-2023, with a maximum of 3.6x in 2022. The Fitch rating case (FRC) assumes 8% container throughput decline in 2020, and a recovery to the pre-outbreak level in 2021. We assume the throughput will rise at 0.8x GDP thereafter. We also expect throughput to be boosted by the commission of NPCT2/3 and Kijing Port. We forecast throughput to rise at 2.3% CAGR between 2018 and 2023. We assume container tariffs will increase by 2% each year. We assume cash operating expenses will increase by 6% CAGR over the same period. Our revised FRC generates an average adjusted net debt/EBITDAR of 3.1x, with a maximum of 4.1x in 2022. We also ran a COVID-19 stress case where we assumed the throughput would drop by 13% in 2020 and recover to the pre-outbreak level only in 2022. Our COVID-19 stress case generated a leverage average of 3.4x, with a maximum of 4.6x in 2022.

"(Repeats to add slug, with no changes to text) NEW DELHI, Nov 26 (Reuters) - India's Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Tuesday he was confident India's imports of coking coal from Russia would increase significantly in coming months, adding that steelmakers had started testing samples of Russian coal. India long depended on Australia to meet most of its coking coal requirements but has progressively cut down on imports from the country in the last three years. ""Offtake of coal from Far East Russia can grow as the coking coal...becomes more attractive from the point of view of price, ease of availability, connectivity to the ports and sea transport,"" the Ministry of Steel quoted Pradhan as saying in a statement. Shipments of coking coal from the United States and Canada rose to a sixth of all Indian imports of the fuel during the year ended March 2019, according to government data, while Australia's share fell to 71% from about 88% three years ago. Interruptions to Australian supply in recent years, including a flood in a major coal producing region in February and a cyclone which tore into Queensland in 2017, raised concerns in India. Overall coking coal imports to India, one of the world's fastest growing major economies, rose 10.3% to 51.84 million tonnes in 2018/19, with demand for the fuel expected to more than double over the next 10 years. The country plans to increase annual crude steel production to 300 million tonnes by 2030 from 132 million tonnes currently, with steelmakers importing the bulk of their coal due to scarce domestic production. An Indian coal ministry official told Reuters earlier this month that Russian companies were interested in India's plans to open up its coal mining industry to global miners for the first time, saying they were ""getting involved aggressively"". India's top aluminium and copper producer Hindalco Industries has signed a memorandum of understanding with Russia's Far East Agency for investment in minerals such as copper and thermal coal, the steel ministry said in the statement.

"WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump tweeted his support on Monday for a call by a cable industry group to investigate alleged anti-competitive practices by Comcast Corp, the world's biggest entertainment company. The American Cable Association (ACA), which represents hundreds of smaller cable and broadband providers, on Monday said in a statement that it has asked the Justice Department's antitrust division to investigate Comcast's business practices, ""focusing on harms stemming from the dominant communications firm's control of cable systems, TV stations, and regional sports networks concentrated in some of the largest local markets in the country."" Trump appeared to agree with the industry' group's call for a probe, which it said it made to the Justice Department in a Nov. 6 letter. ""American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast. They say that Comcast routinely violates Antitrust Laws,"" Trump said on Twitter. Comcast's shares dipped following the president's tweet but quickly recovered most of their losses in a market that was broadly lower. Comcast shares were down about 0.2 percent in late trading. It is not the first time that Trump has weighed in on regulatory issues related to media companies. In July, he said the Federal Communications Commission's decision to reject Sinclair Broadcast Group's purchase of Tribune Media was ""disgraceful."" Two years ago, when Trump was the Republican presidential candidate, he had denounced AT&T Inc's deal to buy Time Warner Inc, whose businesses included CNN, which Trump has repeatedly attacked. The ACA said in its call for a probe that with the expiration of requirements that were imposed on Comcast following its 2011 acquisition of NBC Universal, its ""ability to raise programming prices in local markets is unmatched by any similar problem created by the AT&T-TW combination."" The ACA said it was particularly concerned about its members' access to regional sports networks. ""ACA expects – and there is every reason for DOJ (Justice Department) to expect -- Comcast-NBCU to act on its natural incentives and use its capabilities to harm rivals, unless the government somehow, either through structural or behavioral remedies, deals with them,"" the group said in its letter. Comcast did not respond to the president's tweet, but said that the ACA letter was ""without merit and constitutes an inappropriate attempt to gain leverage in the commercial marketplace."" ""At Comcast NBCUniversal, we are competing in this dynamic environment the way we always have – by continuing to innovate and conducting our business in compliance with antitrust laws and other legal requirements,"" the company said in a statement.

"Aug 28 (Reuters) - Photo-sharing app Instagram's more than 1 billion users will now be able to evaluate the authenticity of accounts, weeks after parent Facebook Inc rolled out similar measures in a bid to weed out fake accounts on its social media platform. Instagram said on Tuesday it will launch the ""About This Account"" feature that will allow users to see the advertisements an account is running, the country where the account is located, username changes in the past year as well as other details. ""Keeping people with bad intentions off our platform is incredibly important ... that means trying to make sure the people you follow and the accounts you interact with are who they say they are, and stopping bad actors before they cause harm,"" Instagram co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Mike Krieger said. Instagram also said it will allow the use of third-party apps such as DUO Mobile and Google Authenticator for two-factor authentication to help users securely log in to their accounts. Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security on top of usernames and passwords by prompting users for information they have access to. Earlier this month, Facebook introduced this feature for users who managed pages with a large U.S. following, seeking to make it harder to administer a page using a fake or compromised account. These features will be broadly available in the coming weeks, the photo-sharing app said in a blog post. Starting Tuesday, Instagram will allow accounts with a large reach to request verification through a feature within the app, it said.

"(Adds comments on Chinese currency, story link) By David Lawder NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, saying that the U.S-China trade war was taking a toll and emerging markets were struggling with tighter liquidity and capital outflows. The new forecasts, released on the Indonesian resort island of Bali where the IMF and World Bank annual meetings are getting underway, show that a burst of strong growth, fuelled partly by U.S. tax cuts and rising demand for imports, was starting to wane. The IMF said in an update to its World Economic Outlook it was now predicting 3.7 percent global growth in both 2018 and 2019, down from its July forecast of 3.9 percent growth for both years. The downgrade reflects a confluence of factors, including the introduction of import tariffs between the United States and China, weaker performances by eurozone countries, Britain and Japan, and rising interest rates that are pressuring some emerging markets with capital outflows, notably Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, South Africa, Indonesia and Mexico. ""U.S. growth will decline once parts of its fiscal stimulus go into reverse,"" IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said in a statement. ""Notwithstanding the present demand momentum, we have downgraded our 2019 U.S. growth forecast owing to the recently enacted tariffs on a wide range of imports from China and China’s retaliation."" With much of the U.S.-China tariff war's impact to be felt next year, the Fund cut its 2019 U.S. growth forecast to 2.5 percent from 2.7 percent previously, while it cut China's 2019 growth forecast to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent. It left 2018 growth forecasts for the two countries unchanged at 2.9 percent for the United States and 6.6 percent for China. Obstfeld said he was not concerned about the Chinese government's ability to defend its currency against further weakening but told a news conference that Beijing would face a ""balancing act"" between actions to shore up growth and ensuring financial stability. If China and the United States were to resolve their trade differences, it ""would be a significant upside to the forecast."" The eurozone's 2018 growth forecast was cut to 2.0 percent from 2.2 percent previously, with Germany particularly hard hit by a drop in manufacturing orders and trade volumes. Obstfeld said the IMF does not see a generalized pullback from emerging markets, nor contagion that will spill over to those emerging economies which have stronger economies and have thus far avoided major outflows, such as some in Asia and some oil and metals exporting countries. ""But there is no denying that the susceptibility to large global shocks has risen,"" Obstfeld said. ""Any sharp reversal for emerging markets would pose a significant threat to advanced economies."" Brazil will see a 0.4 percentage-point drop in GDP growth to 1.4 percent for 2018 as a nationwide truckers strike paralyzed much of the economy. Iran, facing a new round of U.S. sanctions next month, also saw its growth forecast cut, the IMF said. Some energy-rich emerging market countries have fared better due to higher oil prices, with Saudi Arabia and Russia receiving upgrades to growth forecasts. The IMF said the balance of risks was now tilted to the downside, with a higher likelihood that financial conditions will tighten further as interest rates normalize, hurting emerging markets further at a time when U.S.-led demand growth will start to slow as some tax cuts expire. Trade tensions are expected to continue although Fund officials view U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement as a positive sign. ""Where we are now is we’ve gotten some bad news. Our probability that we would attach to further bad news has gone up,"" Obstfeld said. TRADE WAR RISKS In a new simulation exercise to show trade war risks to the global economy, the IMF modelled the effect of an all-out U.S.-China trade war, coupled with threatened global U.S. automotive tariffs and retaliation from trading partners. The model also includes the effects of a reduction in business confidence that reduces investment and leads to a tightening of financial conditions. It found that global GDP output under this scenario would fall by more than 0.8 percent in 2020 and remain roughly 0.4 percent lower in the long-term compared to levels without the effects of a trade war. The repercussions for the United States and China would be particularly severe, with 2019 GDP losses of more than 0.9 percent in the United States and 1.6 percent in China in 2019. The exercise assumes that U.S. President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on the remaining $267 billion worth of Chinese goods imports not already under punitive tariffs and China retaliates in kind. It also assumes that Trump imposes a 25 percent tariff on imported cars and auto parts. Adjustments would occur as domestic production displaces higher-priced imports, the model shows, but in the long run, the U.S. GDP would still be 1.0 percent below a baseline without these tariffs, while China's GDP output would be one half percent below the baseline.

""We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and removedthis episode only in Saudi Arabia after we had received a validlegal demand from the government -- and to comply with locallaw,"" a Netflix spokesperson said.

"By Daniel Wiessner (Reuters) - A federal judge in Washington D.C. on Tuesdaycriticized the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for notbeing ready to collect pay data broken down by sex and race thatlarger companies must submit under an Obama-era rule. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan at a hearing said the EEOCshould have been prepared for her ruling in March reviving therule, which the Trump administration had blocked from takingeffect, in a challenge brought by the National Women's LawCenter. But she put off a decision on whether to approve the EEOC'sproposal to set a September deadline for employers to submit thedata. Chutkan last month agreed with the NWLC that the White HouseOffice of Management & Budget failed to adequately explain its2017 decision to stay and further review the reporting rule,which would have taken effect in March 2018. Following the ruling, the EEOC said it would not collect thedata by May 31, the deadline for employers to submit otherinformation that they have been required to disclose fordecades, and proposed a Sept. 30 deadline. The NWLC says theagency should be able to collect it by next month. At Tuesday's hearing, Chutkan grilled two U.S. Department ofJustice lawyers representing the EEOC on why it had not begunpreparing to implement the rule between late 2016, when it wasadopted, and a year later when it was stayed. ""Certainly there should have been efforts made before (thedecision) to get ready ... and what I've heard and what's beensubmitted to me hasn't given me much reason to believe thatthere was anything done,"" Chutkan said, according to atranscript reviewed by Reuters. The judge gave both sides until Monday to submit briefsbefore she decides on the proper deadline. An EEOC spokeswoman declined to comment. So did aspokeswoman for legal group Democracy Forward, which representsthe NWLC. The NWLC and other supporters of the reporting rule say itwill help the EEOC identify and address discriminatory wagegaps. But trade groups have said the data could invitecomparisons of employees in different jobs with varyingqualifications, calling the value of the information intoquestion, and could trigger a wave of lawsuits if it isdisclosed publicly. The EEOC's chief data officer, Samuel Haffer, testified atTuesday's hearing that the agency needs time to finalize acontract with the University of Chicago to assist in collectingthe data, and a May 31 deadline was implausible. Haffer said the EEOC did not have the infrastructure inplace to handle the inevitable influx of calls from employers.And even with a September deadline, he said, the commission willhave some difficulty addressing companies' concerns. ""We're just going to have to really be doing updating ofFrequently Asked Questions on the fly to make this work,"" Haffersaid. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups in anamicus brief last week told Chutkan that employers need up to 18months to revise their computer systems, implement newprocedures, and train employees.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Chicago-July 25: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A+' (Strong)Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of American Family Mutual InsuranceCompany and its subsidiaries (American Family). The Rating Outlook has beenrevised to Stable from Negative. A complete list of rating actions follows atthe end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's affirmation of American Family's ratings and Outlook revision to Stablereflects the company's very strong capitalization and business profile, strongunderwriting, and sufficient reserve position. Today's rating action considers American Family's current plan to acquire IDSProperty and Casualty Insurance Company (IDS), unrated by Fitch, for $1.05billion. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and anticipated toclose in fall 2019. The acquisition enhances business profile by diversifying American Family'sgeographical, product, and distribution mix. Fitch has analyzed capital trendsfollowing the acquisition and believes they will fall within rating parameterson a proforma basis. American Family's typically low financial leverage ratio of approximately 8%will likely increase to 15% following the IDS acquisition. Favorably, themajority of the debt is held at the lead operating company, and consequently theentire asset portfolio is available to service the debt and is not constrainedby statutory dividend requirements. From a Prism capital model perspective, the company scored in the ""Very Strong""category for 2018 consistent with prior year.  Fitch expects that post IDSacquisition Prism output will not change materially. American Family's calendar year combined ratio was 104% for year-end (YE) 2018 a4 percentage points (pp) improvement over prior year but below peers, ratingexpectations, and industry averages. American Family's management is activelytargeting improvement but could be challenged by the lower historicalprofitability of both IDS and Main Street America (acquired in October 2018),which had five-year average statutory combined ratios of 110% and 108%,respectively. Including Main Street America in full-year 2018 would increase theconsolidated calendar year combined ratios by approximately 3 pp. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following items could result in a ratings upgrade: --Sustained improvement in the combined ratio approaching 95% or better; --Maintaining a 'very strong' or better score for capital in the ratingnavigator. The following could result in a downgrade: --A material deterioration in operating performance, such as a sustainedcombined ratio approaching 105%; --A sustained reduction in key capital factors that result in a change to'strong' from the current 'very strong' view Fitch portrays in the ratingsnavigator; --An unexpected emergence of material issues in integration efforts of recentacquisitions.

"(Adds comments from critical U.S. senators, background, details) * Deal would allow Kurdish forces to leave ""safe zone"" * Unclear if Kurdish forces will fully comply * Ankara got ""exactly what we wanted"" - official * ""Millions of lives will be saved!"", Trump tweeted * U.S troop withdrawal presaged Turkey's assault * Critics accuse Trump of abandoning Kurdish allies By Humeyra Pamuk, Ece Toksabay and Tuvan Gumrukcu ANKARA, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Turkey agreed on Thursday to pause its offensive in Syria for five days to let Kurdish forces withdraw from a ""safe zone"" Ankara had sought to capture, in a deal hailed by the Trump administration and cast by Turkey as a complete victory. The truce was announced by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence after talks in Ankara with Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan, and was praised by President Donald Trump, who said it would save ""millions of lives"". But if implemented it would achieve all the main objectives Turkey announced when it launched its assault on Oct. 9: control of a strip of Syria more than 30 km (20 miles) deep, with the Kurdish militia, once U.S. allies, obliged to pull out. It was also unclear if the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would fully comply. SDF commander Mazloum Kobani told Ronahi TV the group would accept the ceasefire agreement with Turkey in northern Syria but said it was limited to the border areas running between the towns of Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad. Republican and Democratic senators accused Trump of having betrayed the Kurdish allies who were vital in fighting Islamic State militants, of brushing aside the humanitarian costs of Turkey's invasion and of being outwitted by Ankara. ""The safe zone will be primarily enforced by the Turkish Armed Forces,"" a joint U.S.-Turkish statement released after the talks said. U.S. senators who have criticised the Trump administration for failing to prevent the Turkish assault in the first place said they would press ahead with legislation to impose sanctions against Turkey despite the ceasefire announcement. A Turkish official told Reuters that Ankara got ""exactly what we wanted"" from the talks with the United States. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu described it as a pause, solely to allow the Kurdish fighters to withdraw. Kurdish fighters would be forced to give up their heavy weapons and their positions would be destroyed, Cavusoglu said. He declined to call the agreement a ""ceasefire"", saying ceasefires could be agreed only by legitimate sides, and not by a Kurdish militia that Turkey considers a terrorist group. ""When the terrorist elements completely leave the safe zone, we can stop the operation,"" Cavusoglu said. The joint declaration said Washington and Ankara would cooperate on handling Islamic State fighters and family members held in prisons and camps, a major international concern. DOUBTS OVER KURDISH RESPONSE Pence said Washington had already been in contact with the Kurdish-led SDF, which had agreed to withdraw and were already pulling out. However, the Kurdish position was not clear. Speaking to Ronahi TV, SDF commander Kobani said the agreement is ""just the beginning"" and will not achieve Turkey's goals. Aldar Xelil, a leading Syrian Kurdish politician, told Al Arabiya television that the Kurds would abide by the ceasefire but would defend themselves. Pence said that once the pause became permanent, Washington would go ahead with its own plans to withdraw its entire military force from northern Syria, which had partnered with the Kurds to fight against Islamic State. There were no signs that U.S. forces had ceased their withdrawal, a U.S. official said. Trump tweeted: ""Great news out of Turkey"". ""Thank you to Erdogan,"" Trump said. ""Millions of lives will be saved!"" ""Today the United States and Turkey have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria,"" Pence told a news conference after more than four hours of talks at the presidential palace in Ankara. ""The Turkish side will pause Operation Peace Spring in order to allow for the withdrawal of YPG forces from the safe zone for 120 hours,"" Pence said. ""All military operations under Operation Peace Spring will be paused, and Operation Peace Spring will be halted entirely on completion of the withdrawal."" The deal struck with Erdogan also provided for Turkey not to engage in military operations in the flashpoint Syrian border town of Kobani, Pence said. Cavusoglu said Turkey had given no commitments about Kobani. HUMANITARIAN CRISIS Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican, said the agreement ""is far from a victory"" and demanded the administration explain what will happen to the Kurds, what will be the future U.S. role in the region and why Turkey ""will face no apparent consequences."" ""The ceasefire does not change the fact that America has abandoned an ally. Adding insult to dishonor, the administration speaks cavalierly, even flippantly, even as our ally has suffered death and casualty,"" Romney said on the Senate floor. ""What President Trump agreed to today is a capitulation to Turkey at the expense of our Kurdish allies,"" Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, said in a statement, saying ""the agreement lets Turkey off the hook for slaughtering innocent civilians."" The Turkish assault has created a new humanitarian crisis in Syria with 200,000 civilians taking flight, a security alert over thousands of Islamic State fighters potentially abandoned in Kurdish jails, and a political maelstrom at home for Trump. Trump has been accused of abandoning Kurdish-led fighters, Washington's main partners in the battle to dismantle Islamic State's self-declared caliphate in Syria, by withdrawing troops from the border as Ankara launched its offensive on Oct. 9. The U.S. House of Representatives had condemned his policy on Wednesday in a vote backed by a majority of his fellow Republicans as well as Democrats. The Turkish assault began after Trump moved U.S. troops out of the way following an Oct. 6 phone call with Erdogan. Trump announced sanctions on Turkey on Monday, after the assault began, but critics said these were too little, too late. Pence said the sanctions would be lifted once the ceasefire became permanent. If successful, the deal could smooth over a major rift between Washington and Turkey, the only Muslim NATO ally. But the U.S. withdrawal also leaves U.S. adversaries Russia and Iran in a far stronger position in Syria. The Kurds responded to the U.S. withdrawal by effectively switching allegiances and inviting Syrian government forces, backed by Moscow and Tehran, into towns and cities in areas they control. There could be friction both along the edges of the new safe zone claimed by Turkey, and within it, where government forces have advanced in recent days.

"    * Philippine peso, S. Korean won skid     * Malaysia's Nov. exports drop     * Investors rush to safe-havens gold, yen   (Adds text, updates prices)     By Shriya Ramakrishnan     Jan 3 (Reuters) - Most emerging Asian currencies weakened on Friday, with major oil importers taking the biggest hit, as oil prices surged after tensions escalated in the Middle East.     Brent crude futures jumped nearly $3 to their highest since September on concerns over supply disruption following a U.S. air strike at Baghdad airport that killed key Iranian and Iraqi military personnel.     As a result, South Korean won weakened as the Asian economy is one of the largest crude buyers in the world. It fell 0.8% to hit a more than two-week low.      The Philippine peso skid 0.7% to mark its worst level in nearly a month.      Both the won and peso were poised to record a weekly loss of 0.5%.      ""Asian currencies had seen quite moderate gains in December. So, that could be some trigger for profit-taking, especially with renewed geopolitical uncertainty,"" Wei-Liang Chang, an FX and Credit macro strategist at DBS Bank said.       The Japanese yen, seen as a safe harbour during times of economic or global tensions due to Japan's status as the world's creditor nation notched robust gains against the dollar.     The Indian rupee depreciated 0.4% to the dollar, while the Indonesian rupiah also slipped 0.2%. India meets about 80% of its oil needs through imports, making it highly vulnerable to fluctuations in prices.       Weaker export readings weighed on the Malaysian ringgit , which dipped 0.3%. The country's exports dropped for a fourth straight month in November on lower shipments of manufactured goods and commodities.     The pace of decline was, however, slower than the 6.7% fall recorded in October.     ""Exports growth will probably recover, though any pick-up may be mild for now,"" analysts at Mizuho Bank said in a note.      The Singapore dollar weakened 0.2%, while the Thai baht was largely flat.     The Chinese yuan eased slightly, while the Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.1%.

"(Adds details on results, background on competition) Feb 14 (Reuters) - Drugmaker Indivior Plc said onThursday its full-year operating profit rose largely due to costcuts even as it braces for the launch of cheaper copies of itsblockbuster drug Suboxone after a long patent battle in U.S.courts. The company this week lost the latest leg of its battle todelay the launch of generic versions of the film-based opioidaddiction drug. It said operating profit jumped 51 percent to$292 million in 2018, while net revenue fell 8 percent to $1.01billion. Indivior said it expects net revenue of between $50million and $70 million in 2019 from its long-lasting Sublocadeinjection. Jefferies analysts said the guidance was ahead oftheir estimates. Indivior said it would not be able to forecast revenue andnet income for 2019, given uncertainties around how the U.S.market for both Suboxone and generic alternatives willultimately develop. The United States, which accounts for 80 percent ofIndivior's revenue, faces an opioid abuse epidemic thatPresident Donald Trump has declared a public health emergency,signalling a big opportunity for Indivior's newer opioidaddiction treatments and Suboxone, which generates the bulk ofits revenue. Indivior, however, has spent over two years fighting severallegal battles and patent disputes to fend off generic rivals toSuboxone and has also faced some regulatory hiccups. The company has said it faces potentially severe losses inmarket share in the immediate future to copycat products fromIndia's Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and Alvogen PineBrook, which would also open doors for other copycats to followsuit. Indivior has put in place a multi-phase contingency plan tofight generic competitors to Suboxone, which includes launchingits own generic version to undercut losses and hold a minimumcash balance of $250 million to comply with its debt covenants. The company is also looking to its schizophrenia treatmentPerseris to move away from the Suboxone film. Commercial launchof the treatment will take place in the week of Feb.18, it said.(Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by ArunKoyyur)",UPDATE 1-Costs cuts help Indivior post 2018 profit jump,drugmaker indivior plc said onthursday its full-year operating profit rose largely due to costcuts. the company this week lost the latest leg of its battle todelay the launch of generic versions of the film-based opioidaddiction drug.,"update 1-indivior profit rises on cost cuts , braces for launch of suboxone copycats"
"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Seoul-February 12: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the rating of South Korea-based SHINSEGAE Inc.'s (Shinsegae) USD300 million 2.625% guaranteed subordinated notes at 'A'. The rating reflects the credit enhancement provided to investors by the guarantee from Kookmin Bank (KB, A/Stable). Fitch considers the first-call date when the guarantee would terminate as the effective maturity date of the securities. Key Rating Drivers KB as Guarantor: The rating reflects the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee from KB. The notes are rated at the same level as KB's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), as its guarantee makes the notes the bank's direct, general, unsubordinated and unconditional obligations, which rank at least pari passu with all its other present and future unsubordinated and unsecured obligations. Effective Maturity Date: Fitch views the first-call date as the effective maturity date. Under the note terms, unless the notes have been fully redeemed before the first-call date in May 2020, the first-call date will be the date when the guarantee is no longer effective. Fitch assumes all bondholders will execute the ""no call put right"" of the notes on the first-call date due to the termination of guarantee. The ""no call put right"" states that if the issuer elects not to redeem the notes on the first-call date, each holder has the right to sell the note in whole to the guarantor. Shinsegae's Credit Not Considered: Shinsegae's standalone credit strength is not a consideration in the instrument rating, as the guarantee remains in force even if Shinsegae is declared bankrupt. RATING SENSITIVITIES Any change in Fitch's assessment of KB's ratings will result in an equivalent change in the rating of the credit-enhanced notes, since the rating on the notes is based solely on KB's guarantee. For the ratings of Kookmin Bank, the following sensitivities were outlined by Fitch in its Rating Action Commentary dated 30 April 2019: IDRS, VIABILITY RATING AND SENIOR DEBT The bank's IDRs, Viability Rating (VR) and senior debt ratings are sensitive to a change in Fitch's assessment of Kookmin Bank's company profile, risk appetite and financial profile. The ratings could be upgraded if there is a sustainable and significant improvement in the bank's company profile and financial strength. The ratings could be downgraded if there is an increase in the bank's risk appetite, including rapid asset growth or weakened loan quality, leading to a sustained erosion of its capitalisation or asset quality. A negative rating action could also be prompted by a substantial weakening in the parent's consolidated risk profile or double leverage ratio, potentially due to a large non-bank subsidiary acquisition, if this significantly increases the bank's dividend burden. The downside to the IDR from changes to the VR would be limited to one notch as the bank's Support Rating Floor is 'A-'. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to any change in Fitch's assumptions about the propensity or ability of the Korean authorities to provide timely support to the bank. This might arise if there is a change to Korea's sovereign rating. A material change in Korea's resolution framework aimed at reducing implicit government support available to banks may cause downward pressure on the ratings. However, there has been limited progress in legislation of key features such as a bail-in and the timeline has become unclear since late 2016. Fitch will assess the strength of the language and the feasibility of enforcing a bail-in legislation in practice when a draft is available. Liquidity and Debt Structure Liquidity Not a Major Concern: Shinsegae had KRW111 billion in cash and cash equivalents and KRW 981 billion of short-term debt at end-September 2019. We expect the company to successfully refinance its debt given the strong banking relationships and multiple funding channels.

"By Yeganeh Torbati and Omar Mohammed WASHINGTON/KAKUMA, KENYA, Sept 12 (Reuters) - On Jan. 19, 2017, Aden Hassan’s long wait to start a new life ended when he stepped off a plane in Columbus, Ohio, half a world away from the Kenyan refugee camp where he had lived for a decade. Years earlier in Mogadishu, Somalia, Hassan’s father, a community organizer, was shot dead by the Islamist militants he opposed. A few years later, a younger brother and sister were killed by gunmen while walking home from school. After Hassan's mother survived an assassination attempt, she fled with her surviving children to neighboring Kenya. The Midwestern winter chill could not dampen Hassan’s hope, as he left the airport with his wife, their two young children and his brother, that Ohio would provide a security and stability the family had not known in years. All that remained was for his mother, her second husband, and Hassan’s brother and sister to join them, which refugee officials assured him would happen soon. ""When we landed at the airport, we felt we could start a new life,"" said Hassan, now 27. ""We were very hopeful, very grateful."" The next day, Donald J. Trump was sworn in as U.S. president. Nineteen months later, Hassan's mother, Fatuma Diriye, a diabetic with heart problems, and his other relatives remain in Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp. Although they were approved for resettlement in the United States at the same time Hassan was, their plans have been repeatedly delayed by the Trump administration's dismantling of longstanding U.S. refugee policy. The State Department declined to comment on Diriye's case. A week after his inauguration, Trump issued an executive order temporarily banning travel from several Muslim-majority countries and halting all refugee admissions. Since then, through procedural changes made largely out of public view, the administration has reshaped the U.S. refugee program, slashing overall admissions and all but halting entry for some of the world's most persecuted people, including Syrians, Iraqis, Iranians and Somalis. This year, with a record high 68.5 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, the United States is on track to take in about 22,000 refugees, a quarter the number admitted in 2016, the last year of Barack Obama's presidency, and the fewest in four decades. In interviews with Reuters, more than 20 current and former U.S. officials described how the Trump administration has abandoned policies established over decades and embraced by Republican and Democratic administrations alike. The officials, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, say the administration has rejected internal findings that refugees could be admitted safely and with little expense. Two senior staff members who questioned the administration's policies were removed from their positions. The administration has instituted opaque and complicated new security vetting procedures that have bogged down admissions and eliminated many candidates for resettlement who would previously have been accepted, many of the officials said. It has extended the strictest kind of vetting to women as well as men from 11 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa. And it has reduced by nearly two-thirds the number of officials conducting refugee interviews, reassigning about 100 of 155 interviewers to handle asylum screenings for people already in the country, including those who crossed the border illegally. ""They're just stuck,"" said Angie Plummer, executive director of Community Refugee and Immigration Services in Ohio, the group that welcomed Hassan and his family last year. ""It's blocking people who absolutely would have been here two years ago."" The Trump administration says the changes were necessary. ""Security improvements in the refugee program made in recent years to mandate additional screening for refugee applicants undoubtedly makes Americans safer,"" said Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security. In addition to far lower admissions overall, the type of refugee admitted has changed under Trump, a Reuters analysis of government data shows. The percentage who are Muslim is now a third what it was two years ago; the percentage who are Europeans has tripled. The shift has led to striking imbalances. Refugees admitted to the United States from the small European country of Moldova, for example, now outnumber those from Syria by three to one, although the number of Syrian refugees worldwide outnumbers the total population of Moldova. Somalis like Hassan and his family now have little chance of getting in. As of Sept. 10, 251 Somali refugees have been resettled in America this year, a 97 percent drop from the 8,300 admitted by this point in 2016. A PREDICTABLE PATH When Hassan and his family started the refugee process, the path was grueling and lengthy, but largely straightforward. Granted refugee status by the United Nations in 2008, Hassan and his family were assigned to the United States for resettlement in 2016. Family members were then interviewed by U.S. refugee officers to establish whether they faced a serious threat if they returned to Somalia. They then had to undergo rigorous security checks put into place after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Because of his age, gender and country of origin, Hassan was subjected to extra vetting. After Hassan's family all passed the checks, they were told they would be sent to Ohio in two groups, one traveling first and the second soon after. Trump's January travel ban disrupted that plan. In addition to suspending travel from some majority-Muslim countries and all refugee admissions, the order capped the maximum number of refugees in 2017 at 50,000, less than half the number Obama had set a few months earlier. Courts eventually barred implementation of the order. The administration replaced it with a less comprehensive version in March of 2017, followed by additional temporary restrictions on some nationalities. Today, no country's refugees are under an official ban, but several nationalities are nevertheless almost entirely blocked. Syrian refugees, for example, were singled out in the first executive order as ""detrimental"" to the nation's interests. In the 10 months since the ban lapsed, only 27 Syrian refugees have been resettled in the United States. By contrast, the United Nations counted 6.3 million Syrian refugees as of 2017, by far the single largest nationality of refugees. Current and former U.S. officials say the new policies have been driven by a small core of top administration officials, including White House senior advisor Stephen Miller; Gene Hamilton, a former advisor at the Department of Homeland Security; and John Kelly, former secretary of Homeland Security and now White House chief of staff. Hamilton, now at the Department of Justice, declined to comment through a spokesman. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Provided with a detailed description of Reuters' reporting, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said that ""the administration is committed to a fair and responsible refugee policy that maximizes the reach and effectiveness of our global humanitarian assistance."" He added that ""America is now safer."" The remaking of the refugee program began with a full examination of screening procedures, something called for in the travel ban. Conducted in the summer and fall of 2017, the review concluded that refugees from all countries could safely be allowed to enter with some tightening of vetting, according to seven current or former U.S. officials who helped formulate or were briefed on the findings. White House staff, including Miller and Kelly, were not happy with that conclusion, said one current and two former officials. In particular, the White House wanted to continue barring refugees from Somalia, Hassan's home country, for reasons that were unclear, the two former officials and a second current official said. That posed a problem: The working group had found no evidence that Somali refugees presented a unique threat. Homeland Security officials proposed that when admissions were resumed, the government would conduct a further 90-day review of refugees from 11 countries, including Somalia. During that time, refugees from the countries would remain effectively blocked. Some members of the working group felt the additional review - which directly affected thousands of refugees - was unnecessary, designed solely to satisfy White House officials. Waldman, the Homeland Security spokeswoman, disputed that assessment. ""The further 90-day review was proposed for absolutely no other reason than to ensure a risk-based approach to the security enhancements,"" she said. The 11 countries - Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - had been identified as potential threats as far back as the early 2000s, and their refugees had long been subject to more rigorous screening. But previous administrations still admitted refugees from those countries. Between 2002 and 2016, they accounted for 36 percent of U.S. refugees. Since the end of the 90-day review, when admissions of refugees from the 11 nations were supposed to continue with additional screening, refugees from the countries have made up fewer than two percent of admissions. Through Sept. 10, 564 refugees from the countries have been admitted since the start of the fiscal year in October, a 98 percent decrease over the same period in 2016, when nearly 34,000 refugees from the 11 countries came to America. Fatuma Diriye, who cannot read or write, does not follow the details of U.S. policymaking. Her son, who does, realized the new procedures posed huge obstacles for his mother. ""I lost a lot of hope that I had before,"" he said. BACKLOG Diriye had cleared all the security screening required in 2016, but now she must undergo an additional advanced check known as a Security Advisory Opinion. That type of vetting previously was required just for men from the 11 targeted countries. The online portal that tracks Diriye's case now says her security status is ""in process,"" but she doesn't know what that means. When the refugee group assisting the family inquired about Diriye's status last month, they were told only that her case is ""on hold pending further review."" One primary source of the long delays, five current or former officials told Reuters, is the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which shares responsibility with other intelligence agencies for Security Advisory Opinions, the extra background checks now required of most refugees from the 11 countries. In May, the State Department limited requests for the advanced checks to 500 per month globally, according to a State Department memo reviewed by Reuters.  The memo cited an increasing ""backlog"" as the reason for the limit, without mentioning the FBI. The cap has effectively kept a large portion of refugees from the 11 countries from progressing beyond the first stages of the refugee process. Asked about its role in the vetting process, an FBI spokeswoman said the agency's ""primary focus is to protect the United States from national security and criminal threats."" A State Department spokesman said improvements in the refugee vetting process have ""had a direct impact on how quickly security checks can be conducted."" 'A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MISSTEP' Some Pentagon officials have expressed alarm to the White House and other agencies about how the new screening measures are affecting one category of refugees: Iraqis who helped the United States in battle. These Pentagon officials say such admissions provide a lifeline to people who risked their lives assisting the United States. As of Sept. 7, just 48 Iraqi refugees with U.S. affiliations had been admitted this fiscal year, according to State Department data. More than 3,000 were admitted last year and about 5,100 in 2016. During a White House meeting last month, FBI officials revealed that their screening had turned up suspicious information on 87 of 88 U.S.-affiliated Iraqis who recently underwent background checks, a far higher hit rate than in the past, according to two officials with knowledge of the meeting. But it is unclear even to people inside the government how the FBI's processes have changed, they said. The FBI spokeswoman declined to give information on vetting processes, saying only that the agency ""takes the necessary time to thoroughly review all the information available."" One Iraqi interpreter, who worked for the U.S. Army for years and was approved for refugee status, described the obstacles he has faced since Trump took office. His account, provided on condition of anonymity, was confirmed by records from a court case against the administration in which he is a plaintiff and by two U.S. veterans who worked with him. After being targeted by militants opposed to the U.S. in Iraq, the man fled to Egypt in 2014 and applied for refugee status. In late 2016, he was accepted. Trump's travel ban delayed his plans. He persisted, however, filing additional paperwork and undergoing new medical exams, and last September was again cleared for travel. Then came the 90-day review of Iraqis and others from the 11 countries. When that lifted, the interpreter said, he was asked to provide information for additional vetting, including 10 years' worth of travel history, residential addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and information about his wife, children and brother - a daunting challenge, he said, given the turmoil in Iraq. ""I can't tell you how exhausting it was,"" he told Reuters. ""In Iraq, for a period of time, it was hard to keep a phone number."" Months after submitting the information, he is still in limbo and fears being deported by Egypt. Not admitting the interpreter is “just a horrible, horrible misstep for national security,” said Chris Brusznicki, a U.S. Army veteran who worked with him in Iraq. People like him, Brusznicki said, “keep Americans from coming home in coffins.” SIDELINED Each September, the president must determine the maximum number of refugees the United States will admit during the next fiscal year. Last year, Trump set the cap at 45,000, the lowest since the modern refugee program was established in 1980. State Department data suggests it is unlikely actual admissions will reach half that number, if they continue at the current rate. With October a few weeks away, the administration now must decide next year’s ceiling. In early meetings, the Pentagon and State Department have supported maintaining a cap of 45,000, one current and one former official said. Refugee advocates fear it will be set lower. In part, that is because two advocates for the refugee program will not participate in the discussions this year: Jennifer Arangio, until July a senior staffer at the National Security Council, and Lawrence Bartlett, a career State Department official who has served in Republican and Democratic administrations. Arangio worked on Trump’s election campaign, but on refugees she found herself in opposition to Miller, Hamilton and their allies, three people who worked with her said, because she supported a higher cap than they wanted. She was turned down for positions she hoped to get at the State Department, including in the bureau that handles refugees, said two people familiar with her departure. In July, she was fired from her NSC job. Arangio declined to comment. Bartlett was removed as director of U.S. refugee admissions late last year. He is now posted to Turkey, according to his LinkedIn profile. Both Bartlett and the State Department declined to comment on his removal. Sarah Breen, a spokeswoman for the agency’s Inspector General, said her office is “conducting a review of allegations of political retaliation against Department of State employees.” Hassan and his family are learning to navigate their new life. They live in a modest apartment furnished with donations. He has gotten a driver's license and a job on the overnight shift at an Amazon warehouse, and his English is improving. Last month, Hassan’s wife gave birth to their third child, a girl. They take the older children to a nearby park to ride bicycles. But he worries about his family in Kenya. Diriye, her husband and Hassan’s 10-year-old brother and 14-year-old sister remain in a two-room shelter at the Kakuma camp, home to nearly 150,000 refugees. Their home has no running water or electricity. They survive on U.N.-supplied rations and whatever money Hassan can send each month. Diriye does not know when or if she will meet her new granddaughter. Recently, the online portal tracking her case had additional information: Her required medical exam was no longer current and needed to be repeated, but she must wait to be contacted about a new appointment. ""Please be patient,"" it says.

"By Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Thursdaypassed legislation to crack down on  sexual harassment bymembers of Congress, requiring lawmakers to pay for settlementsand some court awards themselves, instead of depending on publicfunds.

""We want to thank 1,500 former staff members of Congress whowrote a letter to us who made the case all too clear, thatsexual harassment in Congress was a huge problem,"" she said. Congress acted more than a year after the #Metoo battlebegan against sexual harassment of women. Hundreds ofhigh-profile men around the world have been fired or haveresigned from their jobs in politics, media, entertainment andbusiness after facing allegations of sexually harassing orassaulting women and men. Over the past year, several U.S. lawmakers have left officefollowing sexual misconduct allegations, including DemocraticSenator Al Franken, Democratic Representative John Conyers, andRepublican Representatives Trent Franks and Blake Farenthold.They all denied the allegations. Under the legislation, lawmaker liability would be capped at$300,000 when a court has assessed the damages, but there wouldbe no limit on lawmaker liability for settlements. Currently,the money is paid from taxpayer-funded accounts. The legislation says Congress must also regularly report andpublish settlements, a departure from past practices in whichsettlements were secret. Farenthold left Congress in April, several months afterPolitico reported he settled a sexual harassment lawsuit withtaxpayer funds. He denied wrongdoing, but pledged to pay themoney back. The bill takes other steps to strengthen worker protectionsfor congressional employees, such as eliminating month-longperiods for ""counseling"" and ""cooling off"" that were required ofemployees who made harassment claims.

"(Adds details on sectors) BOGOTA, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Colombia's economy expanded less than expected in the third quarter, the government's statistics agency said on Thursday, indicating that months of rate cuts by the central bank may be having a slower effect than hoped. Gross domestic product grew 2.7 percent in the third quarter, better than the 1.7 percent growth in the same three-month period of 2017, but less than the 3 percent predicted by the market. The economy expanded 0.2 percent from the second quarter, the DANE agency said. Growth was driven by public administration, defense, education and health, which rose 4.5 percent, followed by information and communication, up 3.7 percent, then professional, scientific and technical activities, which grew 3.6 percent. Provision of energy, gas and air conditioning rose 3 percent, manufacturing was 2.9 percent higher than a year ago, and retail grew 2.6 percent. This quarter was the first since 2014 when no sector contracted, the agency said. The central bank predicts the economy will expand 2.7 percent overall this year. GDP growth from January to September was 2.5 percent, DANE said. The economy faces a tough time in the coming quarters, as a new tax reform heading through Congress aims to increase value added tax on food items and other basic goods as well as raise tariffs for the middle class and high earners. ""It's clear that economic recovery, though it continues, has been moderated by news of the tax reform, which has affected consumer confidence,"" Camilo Perez, head economist at the Banco de Bogota said. Economists have warned such taxes will push inflation higher, damping any nascent economic growth. The tax reform makes it likely a tightening cycle may be on the cards sooner rather than later. The central bank cut 350 points from the benchmark lending rate since December 2006, leaving it at 4.25 percent for the last seven months in a bid to stimulate the economy after more than two years of grappling with the fallout from a decline in global oil prices. ""It will be complicated (to meet the 2.7 percent 2018 estimate) because it would require an acceleration in the fourth quarter, and with the uncertainty over the tax reform, consumption will stay moderate,"" Perez said.

"(Adds details, context) By Michelle Martin and Thomas Escritt BERLIN, April 2 (Reuters) - Europe's largest economy might shrink more this year than during the 2008/9 financial crisis, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Thursday, adding that contractions of more than 8% might be registered in some months as coronavirus bites. Germany is in virtual lockdown, with more than 73,000 people infected and 872 deaths from the pandemic. Schools, shops, restaurants and sports facilities have closed and many firms have stopped production to help slow the spread of the disease. Altmaier said the economy had fared well during the first two months of the year - before Germany went into virtual lockdown in March - and said the virus would take a heavy toll on the economy in April before probably reaching its peak in May. ""We expect that in individual months in the first half, the economy could shrink by more than 8%,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday the KfW state development bank said the German economy was likely to shrink by 10-15% in the second quarter. ""The declines I've talked about will probably be at least as bad, if not even worse than with the banking and stock market crisis of 2008/2009,"" Altmaier said, without giving an exact prediction. The German economy shrank by 5.7% in 2009. ""This means that after 10 good years of economic growth, we'll have a recession again this year for the first time since 2009,"" Altmaier added. If there is a stabilisation over the course of the year - and hopes of that remain justified - the balance at the end of the year would be bad ""but perhaps not as bad as some people currently fear"", Altmaier said. The influential Ifo Institute for Economic Research has said output could decline by as much as 20% this year, with the German Economic Institute saying it could shrink by 10%. A panel of economists that advises the government on Monday said the economy could contract by up to 5.4% this year. Parliament suspended Germany's constitutionally enshrined debt brake last week and approved a stimulus package worth more than 750 billion euros ($817.43 billion) to help cope with the economic fallout and around 470,000 companies in Germany have applied for a government short-time work scheme in March due to coronavirus.

Sarri has been under immense pressure of late after hisside's poor form and it seemed he was losing control at Wembleyon Sunday when goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga refused to besubstituted at the end of extra time against Manchester City. Arrizabalaga was dropped by Sarri for the visit ofthird-placed Tottenham with Willy Caballero taking his place --a move that could have backfired on the Italian. As it turned out, Caballero did not have much to do and itwas Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris who became the fall guy. First he was beaten from a tight angle by Pedro in the 57thminute and then he was jointly culpable in a comical own goal byKieran Trippier late on. From being talked about as title contenders a few days agoTottenham have lost two league games in a row and now have thepack closing in below them in the battle for a top-four finish. Chelsea remained in sixth spot, three points behindfourth-placed Arsenal having played a game less. Tottenham are four ahead of Arsenal who they host onSaturday, and five in front of Manchester United. Arrizabalaga's antics had overshadowed what was animpressive display by Chelsea against Manchester City when theywere beaten in a penalty shoot-out. Sarri said dropping him was a ""message to the group"" and itclearly hit home as Chelsea's players put in a shift. ""The performance was in line with the last one andfortunately the result was different -- but the performance wasvery similar to the one against Man City,"" Sarri said. ""I was sure my relationship with my players is really verygood and in the last month better."" Chelsea began at a high-tempo and Gonzalo Higuain twice wentclose to giving them the lead -- first with a sliced shotagainst the post and then with a curler wide. Tottenham's Harry Kane struggled to make an impression,letting his frustration boil over at one point. Harry Winks did go close to giving Spurs the lead with adipping shot against the crossbar. But Tottenham lacked their usual conviction in attack andthey fell behind when Pedro turned inside Toby Alderweireldbefore shooting past Lloris from an unpromising angle. Pedro then showed his defensive qualities with a greattackle on Christian Eriksen as the Dane wriggled through. Yet any hope of a Tottenham comeback was eradicated whenTrippier and Lloris failed to communicate and Trippier'sattempted back pass rolled into an unguarded net.

"(Adds background, details, share buyback, dividend) Feb 25 (Reuters) - Dutch semiconductor manufacturing equipment supplier ASM International expects first-quarter revenue to fall from the guidance-beating levels seen in the previous three months, it said on Tuesday. ASMI sees revenue at between 310 million and 330 million euros ($337 million-$359 million) in the first quarter and 330 million and 350 million euros in the April to June period. In the three months to December revenues rose 48% quarter-on-quarter to 401 million euros. The group said in January its revenues in the period would exceed the guided range of 310 million to 330 million euros provided in October. ASMI, which provides semiconductor manufacturing equipment for chipmakers and semiconductor fabrication plants, said the results were driven by high demand in its logic and foundry segments, which it expects to remain strong in 2020. Fourth-quarter revenue was boosted by 56 million euros in proceeds from the settlement of a licence dispute with Kokusai Electric Corporation, announced in October, which were not included in the guidance. Excluding the one-off gain, revenue was 345 million euros, still above the company's forecast. The group proposed a regular dividend of 1.50 euros per share, which includes the interim dividend of 1 euro per share announced in October, and an extraordinary dividend of 1.50 euros per share. It also said it planned to start a new 100 million euro share buy-back, following the completion last week of the previous one.

"(Adds details, quotes) By Paul Sandle LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Boris Johnson has poached seniorSky boss Andrew Griffith as his business adviser in one of hisfirst appointments before moving into Downing Street, taskedwith repairing relations with the corporate sector ahead ofBrexit. Griffith worked his way up through Sky under RupertMurdoch's ownership, becoming chief financial officer in 2008and helping create Europe's biggest pay-TV group that was boughtby Comcast Corp last year after a multi-billion-poundbattle with Twenty-First Century Fox and Disney. He will be based full time in 10 Downing Street fromWednesday, the first day of Johnson's premiership, Sky's ChiefExecutive Jeremy Darroch said in an email to staff seen byReuters. Griffith, a former candidate for Johnson's ConservativeParty, lent his Westminster townhouse to the incoming primeminister as a base to plot his first steps towards thepremiership. His appointment, just hours after Johnson was votedConservative leader by party members, stands in contrast tooutgoing Prime Minister Theresa May's early approach to thecorporate sector, when she appeared keen to distance herselffrom big business. Griffith will need to build bridges between the City andJohnson, who has said Britain will leave the European Union ""door die"" by Oct. 31. One colleague who worked with Griffith at Sky said he had anincredible intellect and an ability to ""make stuff happen"". Sky's Darroch said Griffith had ""played a fundamental role""in many of the company's collective achievements, includingbuilding its subscriber base from about 3 million in Britain andIreland to more than 24 million across Europe. Griffith was paid 9.10 million pounds ($11.3 million),including 6.77 million pounds under a bonus scheme that vestedin alternate years, in 2016/17, and 2.5 million pounds in2017/18, Sky said in its 2018 annual report. In addition, he received a 17 million pound windfall fromthe Comcast takeover, according to reports.

"By Michelle Price WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Despite measures introduced following the 2007-2009 financial crisis to strengthen the global banking system, non-U.S. banks remain vulnerable to a disruption in the U.S. dollar funding market, the International Monetary Fund warned on Friday. The IMF pointed to the fact non-U.S. banks' dollar assets are rising and remain comparable to their pre-crisis levels, while the currency funding gap between their dollar-denominated assets and liabilities has actually grown since 2008. Because non-U.S. banks, unlike domestic banks, have limited access to a stable base of dollar deposits, they are more reliant on  short-term and potentially more volatile sources of funding, such as commercial paper and loans from other banks. As these funding markets dried up during the financial crisis, non-U.S. banks experienced a dollar funding crunch. That prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve to provide more than $500 billion in emergency funds to overseas central banks, which then lent those funds on to their domestic banks. Regulators including the Fed have since introduced a slew of capital, liquidity, and risk management rule changes that aim to prevent foreign lenders turning to the central bank for emergency liquidity. But in chapter five of its bi-annual Global Financial Stability Report, released on Friday, the IMF said non-U.S. banks continue to play a major role in dollar lending globally. It found non-U.S. banks' dollar assets had risen to $12.4 trillion by mid-2018 from $9.7 trillion in 2012, and remain comparable to pre-crisis levels relative to their total assets. The Fund also found that the gap between non-U.S. banks' dollar-denominated assets and liabilities has widened to about $1.4 trillion, or 13% of assets, as of early 2018, from 10% of assets in mid-2008. ""Thus, increasing U.S. dollar activity has gone hand in hand with a widening gap between U.S. dollar–denominated assets and liabilities, potentially making home economies more vulnerable to shocks arising in U.S. dollar funding markets,"" IMF researchers wrote. Non-U.S. banks' ability to fund their dollar assets over a long time horizon from stable sources, known as the U.S. dollar stable funding ratio, has improved only moderately since 2008, they said. Non-U.S. banks' highly liquid dollar assets, which can be sold quickly in times of stress, also have improved, they noted. Worries over a potential crunch in the U.S. dollar funding market were sparked last month when repurchase agreements and other money market rates soared to levels not seen since the height of the global financial crisis in 2008. The IMF will release its entire Global Financial Stability Report next week. (Reporting by Michelle Price; Editing by Andrea Ricci)","Non-U.S. banks still vulnerable to dollar funding shocks, IMF warns","despite measures introduced following the 2007-2009 financial crisis to strengthen the global banking system, non-u.s. banks remain vulnerable to a disruption in the u.s . dollar funding market. the imf pointed to the fact non-u.s . banks ' dollar assets are rising and remain comparable to their pre-crisis levels.",imf says non-u.s . banks still vulnerable to disruption in u.s . dollar funding market
"(Recasts with source, adds detail) BERLIN, Dec 3 (Reuters) - German federal prosecutors believe Russian intelligence was involved in the August killing of a Georgian citizen in Berlin and want to take over the investigation, a legal source told Reuters on Tuesday, confirming a report by public broadcaster ARD. The measure could raise tensions between Germany -- and other western countries -- and Russia, after strains over the poisoning of a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter on British soil last year. Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, 40, who had previously fought alongside anti-Moscow separatists in the Russian region of Chechnya , was shot twice in the head in a central Berlin park in August as he was heading to a mosque. ""We have evidence that a foreign intelligence agency was behind it and therefore the case is going to be taken over by the federal prosecutor this week,"" said the source, who declined to be named. A suspect was detained shortly after the killing and Der Spiegel weekly has reported that his passport number links him to Russian security services. Berlin prosecutors, who have so far led the case, said the suspect had been caught as he tried to dispose of the presumptive murder weapon in the nearby Spree River, along with a bicycle he had been riding. Russia fought major campaigns in 1994-96 and 1999-2000 against separatists in Chechnya, situated in the Caucasus Mountains on Russia's border with Georgia. Many anti-Moscow fighters from those wars now live in exile and are at odds with the pro-Russian authorities in Chechnya.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-London-June 17: Fitch Ratings has affirmed United Arab BankP.J.S.C. (UAB)'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB+' and ViabilityRating (VR) of 'b+'. The Outlook on the Long-Term IDR is Stable. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this Rating ActionCommentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATING (SR) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR (SRF) UAB's Long- and Short-Term IDRs, SR and SRF reflect a high probability ofsupport available to the bank from the UAE authorities, if needed. Fitch's view of support factors in the sovereign's strong capacity to supportthe banking system, sustained by the UAE's sovereign wealth funds and recurringrevenue mostly from hydrocarbon production. Fitch also expects high willingnessfrom the authorities to support the banking sector. This has been demonstratedby the UAE authorities' long record of supporting domestic banks, as well as bythe authorities' close ties with and part-government ownership links to a numberof banks. UAB's SRF is two notches below the UAE domestic systemically important banks'SRF of 'A' due to Fitch's view that UAB is less systematically important basedon its market share of below 1% of total UAE banking system assets at end-2018. VR The VR reflects UAB's small franchise, undiversified business model, highproblem loan levels and weak profitability, in light of which capitalisation isonly adequate. The VR also factors in the bank's acceptable funding structureand sufficient liquidity. The bank's franchise is small, with a market share of 0.8% of total bankingsector assets and deposits and 0.9% of total banking sector loans at end-2018.UAB is, therefore, a price taker in the UAE and has no discernible competitiveadvantages. The bank offers wholesale and retail banking services, although thebank is more focused on corporate banking, which accounted for 78% of grossloans and 62% of operating income in 2018. Corporate banking is primarily withlocal medium-sized corporates and UAB has significantly reduced its businesswith SMEs. UAB's asset quality deteriorated between 2015 and 2017, due to exposure to theweak SME sector. The stock of impaired loans has since stabilised (AED1.3billion at end-2018 versus AED1.2 billion at end-2017). Nevertheless, the bank'scontracting credit base has been playing inflated the impaired loans ratio,which increased to 9.2% at end-2018 from 8.5% at end-2017. Reserve coverage ofimpaired loans (91.5% at end-2018) is below the sector average but in line withsmaller peers'. This falls to 32% when considering total potential problem(Stage 2 and 3) loans at end-2018. The bank's profitability provides a moderatebuffer against a sharp deterioration in asset quality, with pre-impairmentoperating profit covering 2.3% of the loan book in 2018. Concentration is high,albeit in line with the average for small UAE banks. Profitability has been recovering steadily since 2017 as loan impairment charges(LICs) have been easing, but has remained very low due to the contracting loanbook. The net interest margin stabilised in 2018 as the bank was able to repriceits book; it remained in line with the average of smaller peers despite UABhaving one of the highest cost of funds (2.6% in 2018). The bank's smallfranchise and undiversified business model are constraining fee incomegeneration. In 2018 non-interest income accounted for 24.6% of operating income,in line with the average for small banks. Operating efficiency is poor but in line with the smallest UAE banks'. In 2018,the cost/income ratio was 50.7%, compared with 36% for the banking sectoraverage, despite expenses being on a downward trajectory due to theimplementation of a transformation plan. LICs have fallen but still consumed 76%of pre-impairment operating profit in 2018, well above peer average. UAB's capital position improved in 2018 following a rights issue. Its Fitch CoreCapital (FCC) ratio increased to 14.6% at end-2018, in line with the average forthe small UAE banks. The bank's total capital adequacy ratio and Tier 1 ratiosare compliant with the CBUAE minimum. However, capital buffers are only adequategiven the bank's unreserved problem loans, high single-name concentration(albeit in line with the average for small UAE banks) and weak profitability.The bank has not paid dividends since 2014. UAB is primarily funded by customer deposits, which were a high 82% ofnon-equity funding at end-2018. Current accounts and savings accounts accountfor only 28% of total deposits, which drives the bank's high cost of funding.High reliance on corporate deposits results in high concentrations, with the top20 depositors representing 48% of customer deposits at end-2018, on the highside for a small UAE bank. The bank's liquidity is sufficient. The loans/customer deposits ratio (99% atend-2018) is slightly above peers'. Liquid assets (comprising cash balances anda liquid bonds portfolio) were 28% of total assets and covered 44% of totalcustomer deposits at end-2018. UAB's liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is above100%, but the bank's net stable funding ratio (NSFR) remains below 100%. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SR AND SRF UAB's IDRs are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of the creditworthiness ofthe UAE authorities or on their propensity to support the banking system or thebank. An increase in the bank's market share could also be positive. VR Upside for UAB's VR could come from the bank growing its franchise, diversifyingits business model, or reducing its problem loan exposure. Downside could arisefrom further deterioration in asset quality that affects the bank'sprofitability and significantly erodes capital. The rating actions are as follows: United Arab Bank P.J.S.C.

"CARACAS, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Venezuelan bond creditors on Monday urged the U.S. government to remove newly imposed restrictions on the ability of holders of Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA's 2020 bond to claim collateral after it entered default last month. The U.S. government on Oct 24 temporarily blocked a creditor seizure of PDVSA's U.S. subsidiary Citgo, whose shares were used as collateral for the bond issue. Venezuela opposition leader Juan Guaido took control of Citgo in February after Washington recognized him as the country's legitimate president. The following week, the bond went into default when a $913 million payment came due and Guaido's allies filed a U.S. lawsuit requesting that the bond be declared null. On Monday, the Venezuela Creditors Committee, which groups holders of Venezuelan government and PDVSA debt, said the U.S. government had deprived them of their ""ability to defend its interests"" and said Guaido's team had failed to open dialogue. ""We urge the U.S. Government to remove the newly imposed restrictions on the ability of the 2020 bondholders to enforce the security interest freely granted to them,"" the Committee said in a statement. The Committee criticized Guaido's team for preferring to file a lawsuit than ""engage constructively with creditors."" ""If the Guaido Government wishes to engage with the country's creditors in good faith and to pursue an orderly and consensual renegotiation of the country's external debts, it will have to change its approach dramatically."" A spokesman for Guaido did not immediately respond to a request to comment. Guaido won the backing of the United States and some 50 other countries in January, but President Nicolas Maduro retains control of most state functions and the Venezuelan operations of PDVSA.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-London-October 22: Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlook on Rolls-Royce & Partners Finance Limited's (RRPF) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Negative from Stable. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed RRPF's Long-Term IDR at 'BBB+', Short-Term IDR at 'F2', RRPF's long-term senior secured debt (RCF) at 'A-' and RRPF Engine Leasing Limited's long-term senior secured notes at 'A-'. The Outlook revision mirrors that of Rolls-Royce plc (RR, A-/ Negative) published on 16 October 2019 (see 'Fitch Revises Rolls-Royce's Outlook to Negative; Affirms at 'A-'', available at www.fitchratings.com). RRPF's IDRs reflect Fitch's expectation that support from RR would likely be made available for RRPF, should it be needed. RRPF is a joint-venture (JV) between UK-based RR and US-based leasing group GATX Corporation (GATX). Established in 1989, RRPF is an operating leasing company specialising in the leasing of spare engines (largely from RR) to around 50 airlines globally. As of end-2018, RRPF was the world's largest lessor of RR engines. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS The Long-Term IDR of RRPF is based on Fitch's assessment of support from RR and the Negative Outlook on RRPF's Long-Term IDR mirrors that on RR's Long-Term IDR. The affirmation of RRPF's Long-Term IDR takes into account Fitch's assessment of the important role of RRFP for RR's aftermarket product offering, its close integration within RR on operations and staffing, and shared branding. It also reflects default implications for RR due to overlapping banks in RRPF's and RR's respective RCFs and RRPF's strong track record in generating sound returns and making meaningful dividend pay-outs. RRPF's Long-Term IDR is notched down once from that of RR due to the latter owning only 50% in RRPF with the other 50% belonging to GATX, which could to some extent complicate the provision of support. Nevertheless the notching is narrower than is usually the case for JVs, because GATX is in Fitch's opinion a long-term financial investor and also because of clauses in the shareholder agreement that reduce the potential for JV partner confrontation, specifically those allowing RR to acquire GATX's 50% stake in case of a material disagreement. Fitch's assessment of the standalone creditworthiness of RRPF is moderately weaker than its institutional support-based IDRs and takes into account its sound financial metrics but also the monoline nature of its business model and the modest size of the spare engine lease sector. Asset quality is solid with negligible delinquencies (below 1%) and limited residual value (RV) risk as evident in RRPF's good disposal record over the past 15 years. Profitability benefits from the outsourcing of maintenance activities to RR. Cash flow-based metrics remained strong in 2018 (EBIT margin 52%), while its balance sheet metric weakened due to asset acquisitions towards the end of the year (2018 pre-tax income/average assets 2.9% versus 3.9% in 2017). A long-dated, albeit secured, funding profile exceeding the average lease term underpins liquidity. Its funding base is well-diversified, although reliant on wholesale sources. Balance-sheet leverage defined as debt/ tangible equity increased to 4.2x at end-2018 (2017: 3x) but remained reasonable. The standalone assessment also reflects concentration risk (by engine type and client) as well as RRPF's reliance on RR for business generation. SENIOR SECURED DEBT The 'A-' ratings of RRPF Engine Leasing Limited's RCF and senior secured US private placement notes are one notch above RRPF's Long-Term IDR, reflecting Fitch's expectation of very strong recovery prospects for both the RCF and the notes. This is primarily due to their secured status, with noteholders and RCF counterparties benefiting from an identical security package (i.e. direct security interests over spare engines). RRPF Engine Leasing Limited is a fully-owned UK-domiciled subsidiary of RRPF. RRPF has provided an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee on the notes issued by RRPF Engine Leasing Limited. Financial covenants include a requirement for outstanding debt not to exceed the lower of either the net book value of pledged spare engines or 80% of their externally appraised market value. Loan-to-value ratios have been maintained at a materially stronger level (around 55%) than the corresponding covenant, supporting Fitch's expectation of above-average recoveries for both RCF counterparties and secured note holders. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS A downgrade of RR's Long-Term IDR to 'BBB+' would likely lead to a downgrade of RRPF's Long-Term IDR to 'BBB' as reflected in the Negative Outlook. Given Fitch's current assessment of RRPF's standalone creditworthiness, a downgrade of RR below 'BBB+' would not automatically lead to a corresponding downgrade of RRPF's Long-Term IDR. This is provided, in particular, if RRPF's financial profile metrics remain sound and the downgrade of RR's ratings does not reflect a weakening of RR's franchise and/or business volumes. In addition to a change in RR's Long-Term IDR, RRPF's ratings are also sensitive to the company's importance for RR and a weakening of RRPF's relevance for RR could lead to wider notching. A revision of RR's Outlook to Stable would likely lead to a corresponding revision in RRPF's Outlook. In addition, RR increasing its equity stake in RRPF, though not expected by Fitch, could ultimately lead to an equalisation of RRPF's Long-Term IDR with RR's and lead to an upgrade. SENIOR SECURED DEBT The ratings of RRPF's RCF and senior secured notes are primarily sensitive to a change in RRPF's Long-Term IDR. In addition, worsening of the relative recovery prospect of the RCF and the notes, for instance as a result of a notably higher loan-to-value ratio or changes to the underlying security package, could lead to a downgrade.

"NEW DELHI, April 30 (Reuters) - British carmaker Jaguar LandRover (JLR) will move the assembly of its Land Rover Defender toits plant in Slovakia to make room for newer models at itsfactory in Britain, the company said on Tuesday. The Defender 4X4, which is designed and engineered inBritain, will be unveiled later this year, JLR, owned by India'sTata Motors, said. ""This decision is in parallel with plans for significantinvestment at the company's Solihull plant in the UK to supportthe production of the next generation of flagship Range Roverand Land Rover models,"" JLR said. This is the second model to be built at the Slovakia plant,which was officially launched in October, where JLR expects tohit annual production of 100,000 cars by 2020. The plant was built with an initial capacity of 150,000vehicles and started by taking over production of the carmaker'sDiscovery model. The British government has been wary of carmakers movingproduction outside the country after the industry warned that itwould face possible risks if Britain's impending exit from theEuropean Union is disorderly. The risks, including delays to the supply of parts andfinished models, new customs bureaucracy, the need to re-certifycars and an up to 10 percent tariff on finished vehicles, haveforced carmakers to draw up contingency plans and even brieflyshut production at their plants.

"By Elsa Ohlen UPPSALA, Sweden, April 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - S weden may hold lessons for other economies on how to flex in a crisis, experts say, with firms that prosper in the coronavirus lockdown taking on staff - and costs - from sectors worse hit. Economists say sharing workers could help businesses stay afloat in the global pandemic and deliver better and quicker service to millions of people stuck at home avoiding the virus. ""In this way, we can cater to the needs of both the firms that right now need extra labour, and those that do not,"" said Patrik Karlsson, a labour expert at Sweden's largest business federation. Sweden is one of a few European countries that has not imposed a lockdown, with many Swedes continuing to shop, drink and congregate. Gatherings of more than 50 people are banned in the country which has recorded over 6,000 cases and around 300 deaths. The International Labour Organization says 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide due to the novel COVID-19 and Sweden, like other nations, has seen some businesses thrive while others hemorrhage. HOTELS TO PHARMACIES Tourism, hotels and restaurants are struggling to make ends meet with Swedish retail chain H&M's sales plunging by nearly 50% in March. At the same time, online delivery services, pharmacies, and supermarkets are booming and in need of new staff. The disparity prompted one pharmacy - overwhelmed by a surge in orders - to approach nearby firms struggling to pay the wages of their dormant staff. ""We started reaching out to hotels and local businesses and on social media asking to borrow staff. On Monday, the first employees started,"" said Par Svardson, CEO and founder of online pharmacy Apotea. Forty new people had been taken on in this way with plans to increase the total to 100, he said. Some hotels are lending staff to supermarkets. ""I don't even want to think about what we would have done if we had not made this deal"", said Katarina Ivholt, who lends between four and six people per day, out of the 11 people she employs at a boutique hotel in southern Sweden. But some labour experts say swapping staff on an ad-hoc basis can only help a slowing economy for so long. ""The unemployment insurance and social security (we have) enables increased labour mobility but moving people will not avert the situation we are facing... we are moving towards high unemployment overall,"" said Stefan Westerberg, senior economist at the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

"    SINGAPORE, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Singapore marine fuel sales hit a three-month high of 3.898 million tonnes in September, up 6% on August but still 5% down on the same time last year, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) data showed.     The rise came despite soaring premiums for marine fuels during the month as a result of high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) supply shortages and tighter bunker barge availabilities as the industry prepares to switch to lower sulphur marine fuels from 2020.     New regulations from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will require shippers to reduce the sulphur content to a maximum of 0.5% in fuels, down from 3.5%, starting from Jan. 1, 2020.     Underlining the shift, overall Singapore sales of low-sulphur marine fuels hit a record high in September.     The number of vessels that called at Singapore for bunkers, the world's largest marine refuelling hub, totalled 3,394 in September, up by 3% from last year but 1% lower from August, Monday's MPA data showed.     However, vessels calling at Singapore for bunkers loaded higher quantities of fuel with each ship taking on an average 1,149 tonnes of fuel in September, a two-month high but slightly below the average of 1,168 tonnes per ship so far in 2019.      Since the start of the year, Singapore marine fuel sales totalled a record 35.155 million tonnes this year, down 6% from the previous record of 37.46 million tonnes sold in the same period a year earlier.      FUELS BY TYPE     Singapore sales of low-sulphur marine fuels hit a combined record high of 520,000 tonnes in September, up by 216% from the same time last year and 45% higher from a previous record of 358,000 tonnes in August.

"NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters) - Some Uber Technologies Incdrivers in the United States and Britain said they willstrike on Wednesday, protesting what they call low pay a daybefore the ride-services company launches its initial publicoffering, valuing it at as much as $90 billion. Drivers and regulators around the world have criticizedUber's business tactics almost from the moment of its launch. Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi, hired to help move thecompany past a series of scandals and manage the IPO, haspromised to treat drivers better. Uber is paying more than amillion drivers about $300 million in one-time bonuses forinstance, and has changed policies such as allowing riders totip. Uber has steadfastly and mostly successfully beaten backattempts to compel it to treat drivers as employees, arguingthat its main business is a platform that brings riders anddrivers together. And the money-losing company is under pressureto cut costs. Uber has 3 million drivers globally, and it is not clear ifthe work actions can significantly slow service, althoughorganizers have received widespread publicity. ""Say no to greed,"" announced British union group UnitedPrivate Hire Drivers by Twitter, calling for a ""digital picketline"" in London and three other cities on Wednesday. In the United States, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco,Chicago and several other major cities have planned activities.Many want better pay from Uber rival Lyft Inc, as well. ""Both Uber and Lyft have said that the greatest threat totheir investors is driver dissatisfaction. They know thatthey're paying too little to keep drivers satisfied,"" said LosAngeles organizer Brian Dolber. Uber and Lyft have steadily chipped away at rates,particularly in the more established markets where they have cutback on incentives and bonuses to attract new drivers. They havealso devised more complicated formulas for determining whatriders pay and what drivers earn. Both companies recently slashed the per-mile rate driversearn in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and some driversestimated a loss of 10 percent to 20 percent in earnings. Lyftsaid its hourly wages have risen over the last two years and onaverage are over $20 per hour. An Uber respresentative in a statement said that driverswere the heart of the business. ""Whether it’s more consistentearnings, stronger insurance protections or fully-fundedfour-year degrees for drivers or their families, we’ll continueworking to improve the experience for and with drivers,” theperson said. Uber noted that a recent study whose authors includedcurrent and former Uber employees showed driver gross earningsaveraged $21 an hour. Drivers are classified as independent contractors, and lackpaid sick and vacation days and must pay their own expenses,such as car maintenance and gasoline. A study by left-leaning Washington think tank EconomicPolicy Institute calculated that after all costs and taxes, Uberdrivers earned the equivalent of $9.21 in hourly wages. Organizing drivers is difficult, though, said San FranciscoBay Area-based Edward Escobar, who founded The Alliance forIndependent Workers four years ago. Drivers often work part timeand, sometimes, for a variety of ride-hailing and deliveryservices.

Trading was expected to be light as Japan was shut for apublic holiday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japanwas a shade lower at 524.9 points. It fell alittle more than 1% last week, snapping five straight weeks ofgains. Australian shares slipped 0.8% while South Korea'sKOSPI inched 0.3% lower. Markets will be focussed on Chinese gross domestic productdata due at 0200 GMT, where analysts expect second-quartergrowth to have slowed to 6.2% from a year earlier - the weakestannual pace since early 1992. A disappointing number would add to worries about slowingglobal growth and reinforce the case for more stimulus byChinese authorities as a damaging trade war with the UnitedStates rages on. Alongside GDP, China will also publish activity data forJune including retail sales, industrial production and urbaninvestment, which could give more clues on whether earliersupport measures are starting to kick in, or if more policyeasing is needed. ""The gloom hanging over China’s economy is unlikely to goaway soon due to challenges on both domestic and externalfronts,"" ANZ analysts said. ""To stabilise growth, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) willmaintain an accommodative bias for the rest of the year, in ourview."" Later in the week, U.S. retail sales and industrialproduction data will provide more clues about the health of theworld's largest economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve will releaseits 'Beige Book' on Wednesday which investors will scour forcomments on how trade tensions were affecting business outlook. In currency markets, the greenback was flat at 97.818against a basket of major currencies. The dollar index fell for three days in a row as marketsfully priced in the chance of a 25-basis-point (bps) cut to U.S.interest rates. There is also a small probability of a 50 bpscut. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar languished nearthe lowest since early June at 107.81 while the single currencywas mostly unchanged at $1.1271 after three successivesessions of gains. Expectations that the Fed will keep rates supportive havesent bonds rallying with ten-year U.S. Treasuriesbelow the current Fed rate range of 2.25%-2.50%. ""Dovish Fed rhetoric has rendered a July rate cut, in themarket's eyes, as a fait accompli: it's not if they cut but byhow much,"" Morgan Stanley strategist Hans Redekar told clientsin a note. Redekar said the bank was re-entering its short dollar/longyen position. ""If markets are disappointed, the yield curve would likelyflatten, the USD strengthen, and financial conditions tighten.These forces would exacerbate the already considerable headwindsfacing the global economy,"" he added. ""Global reflation requires a weaker USD to bolster globaltrade and commodity prices."" Worries about world growth and low inflation has meantinvestors are piling money onto bonds and money market funds,Jefferies said, citing its global asset fund flows tracker.

Solskjaer was a surprise choice as caretaker manager,replacing the sacked Jose Mourinho in December, and at the timefew imagined he would end up the man in charge for thelong-term. The club made it clear that they were going to take theirtime to find the right man for the task of restoring the club towhat they feel is their rightful place at the pinnacle ofEnglish football. Would it be Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino? Would it bethen free-agent Zinedine Zidane now with Real Madrid? Giventheir status and resources, United remained an attractiveproposition for any ambitious manager. But the Norwegian, an opportunist striker in the club'sglory years under Alex Ferguson, took full advantage of thechance that fell his way. He combined impressive results with a charm offensive offthe field which would be the envy of any politician to makehimself the inevitable choice. He has been relentlessly ""on message"" from his very firstpress conference, constantly referencing the club's culture, the'United way' and the Ferguson legacy. Of course, crucially, he backed up the 'populist' rhetoricwith results on the field -- they have won 10 of their 13Premier League games since he was appointed and beaten Paris StGermain to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. Solskjaer has shown he has the tactical nous andmotivational abilities to make adjustments to the roles of keyplayers, such as Paul Pogba, and being able to get the best outof several players who were under-performing under Mourinho. But he also had the communications skills to make sure thathis message never felt like spin, never felt too much like anappeal for the job. He swerved direct comparisons with Mourinho and theheadlines that would have followed from any barbed commentsabout his predecessor. GLASS DIVIDE But he also avoided another trap -- that of behaving like atemporary stop-gap, someone who lacked the authority to makemajor decisions. As a player he was known as the 'baby faced assassin' andthe infectious smile disguising a ruthless professionalism hasbeen evident in his new role. United had become a club where there was a strict dividebetween the first team set-up and the rest of the club. Even theCarrington training ground cafeteria was segregated by a glassdivide designed to visibly and physically separate the elitefrom others. Solskjaer had that changed and made it clear that everyplayer, coach and employee was part of the same team, the sameeffort to renew the club's fortunes. Inviting Executive Vice Chairman Ed Woodward to sessions atCarrington was part of that genuine effort to unite the club butit was also smart politics for someone seeking to convince thekey decision-maker of his suitability for the job. The close relationship with assistant coach Mike Phelan,Ferguson's long-term number two, showed Solskjaer was not afraidto have a more experienced voice in the dressing room and italso provided a direct link to the glory years. Ferguson himself was brought closer to the team, visitingCarrington and celebrating in the dressing room after theremarkable win in Paris. But here again, Solskjaer showed deft political skills,effectively dismissing suggestions that Ferguson was pulling thestrings behind the scenes. By restoring the club's confidence and by makingimprovements to performance and results, Solskjaer made himselfthe only candidate for the job. Now his campaign has been successful, the Norwegian knowsthat to make it all worthwhile, he must turn improvement intotrophies. He has the backing of his players, the club hierarchy andthe supporters and will surely be given the finances to back histransfer plans. But a 'feel good factor' is one thing. Winning the PremierLeague when Manchester City and Liverpool have assembled suchimpressive squads is another matter entirely.(Reporting by Simon Evans, editing by Pritha Sarkar)",Soccer-Astute Solskjaer made himself the only candidate for the job,"ole gunnar solskjaer sealed a deal on thursday to become manchester united's new permanent manager. solskjaer was a surprise choice as caretaker manager,replacing the sacked jose mourinho in december. he combined impressive results with a charm offensive offthe field which would be the envy of any politician.",soccer-solskjaer showed deft political skills to make himself inevitable choice for man united job

"* Metal mix in cathodes for EV batteries in focus * In contrarian bet, BASF goes for low-nickel after 2019 * Cobalt more costly but scramble for nickel is on * CEO of chemicals giant BASF needs to boost sagging stock By Ludwig Burger FRANKFURT, Nov 23 (Reuters) - German chemicals giant BASF is betting on a new recipe for electric car batteries which stretches the time between charges while cutting dependence on nickel to help shave costs and grab more of a growing market. It is part of flurry of activity in the sphere of cathodes materials, a major component of battery cells for an anticipated switch to electric vehicles (EV) due to clean air regulation. At the moment BASF and others, including Belgium's Umicore , a market leader, are boosting the nickel content to allow more energy storage and replace expensive cobalt, which is largely sourced from mines in Congo, where exploitation is rife. But BASF is also working on plans to cut the nickel content by more than half while increasing the proportion of cheap and abundant manganese, the company said in response to questions from Reuters. ""In addition, their cobalt-content will be below 5 percent with a target to produce these materials cobalt-free,"" it said. Nickel currently makes up about 60 percent of cathode materials and companies including Umicore and BASF are pushing that up to 80 percent in product launches next year. A slide from a BASF presentation from last year, seen by Reuters, envisaged a cathode materials product made up of just 20 percent nickel and 70 percent manganese in about 2021. It said that would cut costs to just over $40 per kWh of energy stored from well over $50 currently. BASF was less specific in its latest statement to Reuters. ""The market will be ready to adopt such materials in some years from now,"" it said. The company, which elbowed its way into the cathode market with a string of takeovers and investments from 2012 to 2015, competes with several big Asian manufacturers as well as Britain's Johnson Matthey and Umicore. All three European players also produce catalytic converters for diesel vehicles, which are losing favour among regulators due to their emissions, adding urgency to their EV battery push. Umicore declined to comment specifically on its nickel strategy; earlier this year, it said lifting nickel content was key to boosting a battery's energy density - or how much energy a battery can store - and some cobalt was needed for stability. It has a leading position in high-nickel NMC-811, made up of 80 percent nickel, 10 percent manganese and 10 percent cobalt, and has said it is working to improve the product's durability over charging cycles and high voltage stability as well as focusing on recycling. Johnson Matthey is developing a high-nickel cathode material, dubbed eLNO, which it says is safer, more cost efficient and stores more energy than current material. Johnson Matthey's Chief Technology Officer Alan Nelson told Reuters that while the group was monitoring various technologies, it was not developing low nickel, manganese-rich cathoder materials because of ""several key challenges to commercialization"" including fading voltage over charge cycles. EUROPEAN PUSH The cathode materials business is a relatively small part of BASF, but it is one of Chief Executive Martin Brudermueller's flagship innovation projects aimed at lifting BASF's share price after a 20 percent rout since he took over in May. Nickel, mostly used for stainless steel, costs about one fifth the price of cobalt. But BASF estimates that demand for high-grade nickel for electric vehicles will surge to 318,000 tonnes in 2025 from 25,000 tonnes in 2016. That would absorb 58 percent of global supply, in 2016 terms, compared with less than 5 percent in 2016. Materials suppliers as well as carmakers such as BMW and VW are wary of shortages and have been pursuing contracts to secure long-term supplies. The European Union and the German government are running projects to foster local production of battery cells https://tmsnrt.rs/2JnDSOX, most of which are now made in Asia. Asian cathode suppliers include Sumitomo Metal Mining and Nichia from Japan as well China's Ningbo Shanshan and Easpring. BASF has committed to building a cathode factory in Finland and is assessing several European locations for follow-up investments, including Schwarzheide in eastern Germany as part of a 400 million euro investment plan. Johnson Matthey plans to spend 200 million pounds ($263 million) on an eLNO plant that could go on stream from 2021, while Umicore will invest 660 million euros ($744 million) in battery materials in China and Europe. ""Umicore does have a head start but the real growth will start in five to 10 years so it's not too late for the other producers,"" said Patrick Jahnke, portfolio manager at Deka Investments, which owns BASF stock.

"* JD.com says CEO Richard Liu has returned to China to work * Minneapolis police say investigation is ongoing * Liu is student in University of Minnesota doctoral program * JD.com rules require Liu to be present for board decisions (Recasts on Liu's return to China) By Cate Cadell BEIJING, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The CEO of JD.com Inc, Richard Liu, has returned to China, the Chinese e-commerce giant said on Monday, days after he was arrested by police in the U.S. city of Minneapolis on suspicion of criminal sexual conduct and later released. Police said an investigation was ongoing. JD.com, has said that the accusation against Liu, 45, was unsubstantiated. ""He has been released without any charges, and without requirement for bail. Mr. Liu has returned to work in China,"" the company said in a brief statement late on Monday, referring further questions to two U.S.-based lawyers representing Liu. The lawyers, based in Minneapolis, could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment. Minneapolis police said on Sunday that ""an active investigation"" was underway, although it was possible for the billionaire founder of the firm to leave the United States. Reuters has not been able to reach Liu for comment. ""We don't know if there will be charges or not because we haven't concluded an investigation,"" John Elder, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department, told Reuters on Sunday. He declined to provide details of the arrest. In addition to making Liu the highest-profile Chinese businessperson to be accused publicly of sexual misconduct, the case has raised concerns that loss-making Nasdaq-listed JD.com could face difficulties making decisions due to its unusual governance structure. The company is backed by Walmart Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google and China's Tencent Holdings. JD.com's rules require Liu, who holds nearly 80 percent of the company's voting rights, to be present at board meetings for the board to make decisions, although it was not immediately clear if he has to be physically present or could participate by teleconference. ""I'm not aware of any other company that has similar rules,"" said Chris Leahy, co-founder of advisory firm Blackpeak and a corporate governance expert. ""If the board isn't quorate without Richard Liu, if he is unable to attend, and if there are no other provisions that offer a way round that, the company could become ungovernable,"" he said. The Financial Times, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter, reported that the case involved Liu, who is a student in the University of Minnesota's doctor of business administration program, and a Chinese student at the university. While the doctoral program primarily takes place in Beijing in partnership with the prestigious Tsinghua University, the students were in the Twin Cities last week as part of their training. According to its website, the program is designed for top-level executives working in China, and the average age of participants is 50. The complaint against Liu was made just before midnight local time on Friday, and he was released just after 4 p.m. on Saturday, according to the Hennepin County Sheriff website. University spokeswoman Emma Bauer referred questions to the Minneapolis Police Department. China's foreign ministry said its consulate in Chicago was closely watching the situation. ""We are currently seeking information and verification from the relevant U.S. departments,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular Beijing news conference on Monday. SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE Chinese social media was abuzz over the arrest, with a thread on Liu's police booking photo ranking as the most discussed topic on China's Weibo platform on Monday morning, read more than 250 million times. JD.com, one of China's tech heavyweights, competes with larger rival Alibaba Group, and Liu has a net worth of $7.9 billion, according to Forbes. The company, worth some $45 billion, has seen its stock lose 24 percent of its value this year amid concerns of weakening growth momentum. The company has been in and out of the red for the past year and last month reported a second-quarter net loss of $334.4 million - almost twice market estimates - reflecting increased investment. Liu built JD.com from scratch. In 1998, he spent 12,000 yuan ($1,760) of his savings to lease a four-square-metre retail space in Beijing's technology hub of Zhongguancun, setting up a firm that would become JD.com. He is also known for his marriage to Chinese internet celebrity Zhang Zetian. Zhang, described by Chinese media as 24, shot to fame while a student in 2009 when a photo of her holding a cup of milk tea went viral, giving her the nickname ""Sister Milk Tea"". She met Liu while studying in the United States and married him in 2015. In July, a court in Australia denied Liu's efforts to block the release of his name in association with a sexual assault trial in which he was not accused of any wrongdoing, according to a court document. In that case, Liu had hosted a party in late 2015 at his luxury home in Sydney, after which one of his guests accused another guest of sexually assaulting her at a hotel. The defendant was found guilty of seven offenses, according to a court document. Trade in JD.com shares is set to resume on Tuesday as U.S. markets are closed for the Labor Day holiday on Monday.

"(Adds Eurogroup chairman Centeno, details) By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, April 7 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers hope to agree on Tuesday on half a trillion euros worth of economic aid to finance recovery from the coronavirus, a discussion that has sown divisions as the bloc struggles with the outbreak. If they do agree, the joint EU and national government responses could add up to the biggest fiscal support programme in the world, surpassing that of the United States, Reuters calculations showed. But there is no deal is in sight on issuing joint debt, something hardest-hit Spain and Italy have demanded but were denied by the more fiscally conservative Germany and the Netherlands. The ministers will agree on three economic safety nets - for workers, for businesses and for governments, the chairman of the ministers Mario Centeno said in a video statement. ""It is arguably the most sizeable and ambitious package ever prepared by the Eurogroup. It builds on unprecedented efforts already take by governments and monetary authorities,"" he said. ""The economic plan will shield our economic and social tissue as we dive into a recession,"" he said. The fight about how far to go to cushion the downturn has left the ailing south chastising its wealthier peers for not showing enough solidarity and casting it as an existential test that could break the EU. ""It is the same as during the great crisis in the euro,"" Josep Borrell, the EU's top diplomat, told el Mundo on Tuesday. ""We must continue to look for more solidarity."" But the Netherlands, Germany and several others are against mutualising debt. They say that all euro zone countries can still cheaply borrow on the market and EU limits on deficits have been lifted for the pandemic, so there is no need to create eurobonds now - especially since that would take years. ""Eurobonds, I wouldn't do that, and the cabinet also wouldn't do that,"" Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra reiterated. The ministers meet via videoconference from 1400 GMT on Tuesday to prepare a list of ideas for further economic aid that EU leaders might then endorse. LIKELY LIST OF OPTIONS The first is standby credit lines from the euro zone bailout fund of up to 2% of a country's gross domestic product, or 240 billion euros in total. That will come with minimal conditions focused on health issues to alleviate Italy's concerns it would be told to reform its economy to get access to the money. The second is granting the European Investment Bank 25 billion euros of extra guarantees so it can step up lending by 200 billion euros, on top of a 40 billion-euro increase in lending already under way. The third is support for the EU executive's plan to raise 100 billion euros on the market against 25 billion euros of guarantees from all governments in the bloc, to subsidise wages so that firms can cut working hours rather than sack people. Finally, the ministers are likely to back a plan to create an emergency support fund issuing grants for medical supplies and health care, which could reach some 20 billion euros. The ministers will also note a French proposal to create a joint EU solidarity fund to finance long-term recovery. Worth several hundred billion euros and financed by joint borrowing, it is, however, unlikely to get broad support as debt mutualisation is a red line for the frugal camp. ""On the joint liability of all governments, it is no surprise that there are different opinions on this,"" one senior official involved in preparations for the meeting said. ""There is a clear need for more work and discussions."" Spain would like the EU to help finance the recovery by issuing bonds through the Commission, using the EU's long-term budget, now under negotiation, as collateral. But, like the French idea, it is unlikely to get a separate mention but be bundled under the heading of a future strong recovery plan. ""I will call on ministers to make a clear commitment for a coordinated and sizeable recovery plan,"" Centeno said.

"By Ilya Zhegulev KIEV, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsovplans to start making films again and to champion the rights ofprisoners in Russian jails, he said on Tuesday, days after beingfreed in a landmark prisoner exchange between Ukraine andRussia. Sentsov was the most high-profile prisoner to be swapped onSaturday among 35 Ukrainian detainees to return home in exchangefor an equal number of prisoners wanted by Russia. The 43-year-old filmmaker was detained in Crimea in 2014 andsentenced to 20 years in a maximum security prison on terrorismcharges which he says were trumped up. The European Union saidthe case was ""in breach of international law"" and the U.S. StateDepartment called it a ""clear miscarriage of justice"". He went on hunger strike and his fate became a rallying cryfor Ukraine in its conflict with Russia over Moscow's 2014annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in the Donbassregion, in a conflict that has killed more than 13,000 people. The prisoner swap was welcomed in the West and could helpthaw out bilateral relations, although a full normalisation ofties is a long way off. The next step could be a meeting betweenUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his Russiancounterpart Vladimir Putin. Sentsov plans to use his freedom to publish a book and startshooting a film, as well as to champion the rights of Ukrainianprisoners of war and Russian political prisoners, with whom hesaid he feels solidarity. ""I already said that I myself will do everything to raiseawareness about this problem, to keep up people's interest inour prisoners and Russian prisoners,"" he said. ""All of them are prisoners of the Kremlin, they are peoplewho suffer from Putin, and they need help. Our people arecertainly closer to us, but those people are also human beingsand they are our people as well."" Sentsov said he didn't feel any excitement until he huggedhis daughter after getting off the plane that brought him home. ""My main feeling was that it was one of those days life isworth living for,"" he said. Sentsov spent his jail time writing letters, a screenplay,books and a daily diary, filling 15 notebooks. He brought twobags back with him, one filled solely with his prison papers andweighing 22kg (48 pounds), he said. ""Every day, I wrote a diary without knowing what wouldhappen to me,"" he said, adding that letters were also a lifelineand that he had tried to answer as many as possible.

"* Pledges to punish ""all those who have robbed"" Pakistan * Must first decide on whether to ask IMF to aid economy * Only second democratic transfer of power in 71 years (Adds Imran Khan comment, paragraph 20) By Asif Shahzad and Saad  Sayeed ISLAMABAD, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Pakistani lawmakers elected former cricket legend Imran Khan prime minister on Friday and he pledged to bring to justice ""all those who have robbed this country"" through corruption. Parliament's move cleared the way for the 65-year-old Khan to set up a coalition government and his first major task will be to avert a brewing economic crisis after his party swept to election victory on July 25. Khan's party won power on an anti-status quo platform, vowing to fight corruption and lift millions of people out of poverty. Pakistan has been plagued by boom-and-bust cycles and military coups since independence in 1947, as well as by Islamist militant violence in more recent years. Khan, a firebrand nationalist, has promised to create millions of jobs and build world-class hospitals and school systems in the mainly-Muslim country of 208 million people. Among his first challenges will be to decide whether to request an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout to ease currency pressures, or seek support from China and risk deepening Pakistan's economic dependence on its neighbour. ""I want to thank the people and I want to thank God for giving me the opportunity to bring change,"" Khan, wearing a black waistcoat over traditional white shalwar kameez robes, said in a combative speech in parliament. ""First of all we have to do strict accountability,"" Khan added. ""Those who have robbed this country, I will hold each and every one of you accountable."" In a sign of Pakistan's bitter political divisions, opposition lawmakers surrounded Khan and disrupted his speech throughout by shouting ""thief, thief Imran Khan"" and ""puppet"". Khan's election was only the second democratic transfer of power since Pakistan's 1947 independence, and came at a time when relations with on-off ally the United States are fraying over alleged Pakistani support for militants waging war in Afghanistan. Islamabad denies aiding insurgents. Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party holds 151 of the 342 seats in the lower chamber of parliament, short of a majority, but is expected to form a coalition government with smaller parties. In Friday's lower house vote, Khan garnered 176 votes to defeat Shehbaz Sharif from the outgoing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, who won 96 votes. Khan, who will be sworn in on Saturday, has yet to announce his cabinet. LEGISLATIVE HURDLES His success in the election ended decades of political dominance by two dynastic powerhouses, the PML-N of three-time premier Nawaz Sharif, and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), founded and led by the Bhutto family. But Khan will face a battle to push through his ambitious reforms and legislative agenda due to the thin majority in the National Assembly. The Senate, parliament's upper chamber, is controlled by the opposition. ""Legislative business will be difficult for him,"" said Raza Ahmad Rumi, editor of the Daily Times newspaper. Opposition parties allege election rigging and say Khan's path to power was made easier by the tacit support of the powerful military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half its history. The army and Khan's PTI deny any collusion. ""The whole nation has rejected this election,"" said Shehbaz Sharif, demanding an investigation of electoral irregularities. Murtaza Abbasi, a PML-N lawmaker, said in parliament Khan was ""brought here by aliens"", a euphemism for the military. Khan shot back that he had ""struggled 22 years"" to become premier and would not be ""blackmailed"". ""No military dictator raised me. I got here on my own,"" Khan said. How Khan addresses historic civil-military tensions that have dogged successive governments could define his term. No Pakistani premier has ever completed a five-year term in office, including Sharif, whose most recent stint in power was ended by the Supreme Court last year. Sharif, who was jailed over corruption accusations several weeks before the election, saw his second stint in power ended by a military coup in 1999. CURRENCY CRISIS The economy is likely to preoccupy Khan's first few months in office, with his administration facing a battle to reduce a ballooning current account gap and a high fiscal deficit, which shot up to 6.8 percent of GDP in the 12 months to end of June. To deal with current account pressures Pakistan's central bank has devalued the rupee four times since December, while interest rates have been hiked three times this year. A sharp increase in oil prices - Pakistan imports about 80 percent of oil needs - has contributed to a current account deficit that widened by 43 percent to $18 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30. China has also provided billions of dollars in loans to shore up Pakistan's foreign currency reserves, which stand at just over $10.1 billion - enough to cover two months of imports. Earlier this week Asad Umar, widely expected to be appointed Finance Minister, told the English-language Dawn newspaper that Pakistan turning to the IMF would be a ""fallback option"" and that all other possibilities are being explored.

"MOSCOW, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Urals crude differentials were stable on Tuesday in muted trade, while oil loadings from Baltics in January were seen rising as Russian oil companies divert some 2 million tonnes of oil initially planned for Belarus to Russia's sea ports and domestic market in January. A new dispute over oil could be brewing between Russia and Belarus as Russian suppliers divert large volumes of crude to domestic ports in lieu of a deal on 2020 deliveries between the two countries, according to six industry sources. Russia and Belarus have yet to agree on oil transit to Europe in 2020, but the risks of the flows stopping ""should not be exaggerated"", a Kremlin spokesman said. Moscow and Minsk have had several oil and gas rows over the past decade in what has been described as love-hate relationship between president Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko. The Urals crude oil loading plan from Baltic ports was revised up by 0.2 million tonnes to 6.5 million tonnes in January as Rosneft added two cargoes for loading in the last 10 days of next month to the schedule, traders said. PLATTS WINDOW There were no bids or offers for Urals, Azeri BTC or CPC Blend in the afternoon trading session on Tuesday.

"JOHANNESBURG, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Plans to cut some of South African Airways' (SAA) domestic and international routes are aimed at making the airline sustainable and free from government funding after restructuring, experts  appointed to try to rescue the company said on Sunday. State-owned SAA entered a form of bankruptcy protection in December and is fighting for its survival. [nL8N28F0D5} The rescue specialists said on Thursday that SAA would cease flights to Durban, East London and Port Elizabeth from Feb. 29, as well as cutting some international routes, as part of efforts to conserve cash and make the airline more attractive to potential equity partners. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday his government did not agree with plans to cut some of SAA's domestic routes, plunging rescue efforts for the cash-strapped carrier into uncertainty. “We recognize the concerns raised, especially around the domestic routes. We will continue to engage with stakeholders, with a commitment to include inputs into the final business rescue plan, which is due to be published by the end of this month,”SAA business rescue practitioners Les Matuson and Siviwe Dongwana said in a statement. Under South African company law, the business rescue team is entitled to take decisions that are deemed necessary to turn a distressed company around, independently of government. In theory it could ignore the government's objections. SAA is among several South African state entities including power company Eskom that are mired in financial crisis after nearly a decade of mismanagement.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Taipei-October 30: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Bank of Kaohsiung Co., Ltd.'s (BOK) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+', and its National Long-Term Rating at 'AA-(twn)'. The Outlooks are Stable. Fitch has also upgraded BOK's Short-Term IDR to 'F1' from 'F2' and removed it from Under Criteria Observation (UCO), where it was placed following the publication of Fitch's cross-sector Short-Term Ratings Criteria in May 2019. Fitch typically assigns the higher of two possible Short-Term IDRs to support-driven entities where the issuer is rated lower than the supporting entity, which in this case is the Taiwan sovereign (AA-/Stable/F1+), and where Fitch sees no significant potential impediments to the prompt flow of funds from the support provider. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this rating action commentary. Key Rating Drivers IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS, SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR BOK's IDRs and National Ratings are driven by its Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF), which reflect a high probability of support from the Kaohsiung City Government (KCG), which owns a controlling 43% stake in the bank, and ultimately from the Taiwan sovereign, which will flow through the city government, if needed. Fitch believes the propensity for state support is high because BOK has close ties with the municipal government and is systemically important within Kaohsiung, Taiwan's third-largest city, with about 7% deposit market share locally. The ties include KCG's long-term and significant ownership, effective control of the bank's board and management, as well as BOK's policy roles, including being KCG's main banker, providing the city government with treasury services, underwriting and issuing KCG's bonds, lending to the municipal government and distributing policy loans. BOK's National Long-Term Rating of 'AA-(twn)' is underpinned by the agency's expectation of a high probability of state support, if needed. The bank's National Long-Term Rating denotes very low default risk relative to domestic peers. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that the bank's linkage to KCG will remain unchanged in the medium term, primarily based on the city government's commitment to maintain its controlling ownership in BOK and the bank's integral and long-lasting policy role. VIABILITY RATING BOK's Viability Rating (VR) of 'bb+' is mainly constrained by its low profitability and below-average capitalisation. It also reflects the bank's limited franchise and less commercially oriented operations, though its overall asset quality remains sound, supported by its stringent collateralisation policy, and its funding and liquidity profile remains stable, benefitting from its strong relationship with KCG. The bank's profitability is likely to remain below the peer average as about 14% of its loans are low-yield public-sector loans and its operating efficiency is lower than the domestic peer average due to its small scale. That said, the bank's operating profit/risk-weighted assets improved to 0.5% in 1H19, slightly higher than its four-year average of 0.4% during 2015-2018, on lower loan-impairment charges and better net interest margins due to growth in offshore loans and foreign-currency bonds. BOK's capitalisation may increase from the lowering of regulatory risk weights for mortgages and small-amount personal loans starting 2020, in line with most domestic peers. However, BOK's capitalisation is likely to remain the lowest among Fitch-rated Taiwanese banks. The bank had a Fitch Core Capital ratio of 8.9% at end-1H19 compared with the local peer average of 11.7%. SUBORDINATED DEBT The bank's Basel III-compliant Tier 2 (B3T2) bond's 'A(twn)' National Rating is two notches below its National Long-Term Rating of 'AA-(twn)'. This comprises zero notching for non-performance risk and two notches for loss severity, reflecting the poor recovery prospects for B3T2 debt. Taiwan's B3T2 bonds adopt a less easily triggered government receivership as the point of non-viability. Fitch believes Taiwan's authorities would take receivership over a bank only when the bank's total capital-adequacy ratio has fallen to below 2%, reducing the recovery prospects for B3T2 notes. The anchor rating for the subordinated bonds is BOK's support-driven National Long-Term Rating. This is because Fitch believes that KCG and the central government have a strong interest in supporting BOK to fulfil its financial obligations. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS, SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR BOK's SR, SRF, IDRs and National Ratings are sensitive to any changes around the perceived propensity of the Taiwan government to support the bank. This may arise from a dilution in the policy role that BOK performs for KCG and/or weakened linkages between the two in terms of ownership and control. BOK's SR, SRF, IDRs and National Ratings are also sensitive to a change in Taiwan's sovereign rating. VIABILITY RATING A VR downgrade could be triggered by a notable deterioration in BOK's profitability, potentially from rising impairment charges over offshore loans, or significant investment losses, especially in relation to foreign-currency bonds. Further erosion in capitalization, possibly caused by excessive growth in high-risk offshore loans and investments, could also be credit negative to its VR. A VR upgrade is less likely unless the bank's profitability and capitalisation improve significantly to levels that are more comparable with higher-rated peers. However, this would be challenging without sustained improvement in the bank's franchise. SUBORDINATED DEBT Any change to BOK's National Long-Term Rating is likely to trigger a similar change in its debt ratings. ESG Considerations Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of 3 - ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. BOK has an ESG Relevance Score of 4 for Governance Structure due to potential influence by the government on the bank's risk governance given the government's control over the bank's board and management, which has a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-New York-October 30: Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt Receipts (PUTTERs), Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) and Custodial Receipts of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series 5030: --PUTTERs, Series 5030 'F1+'/'F1+'; --DRIVERs, Series 5030 'F1+'; --Custodial Receipts, Series 5030 'F1+'. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'F1+'/'F1+' ratings assigned to the PUTTERS are based on the rating that Fitch has assigned to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPM, rated 'AA'/'F1+'/Stable) provider of the irrevocable direct-pay letter of credit (LOC) securing the custodial receipts deposited in the trust and the tender option provided by JPM for the PUTTERS. The 'F1+ rating assigned the DRIVERs and Custodial Receipts is based solely on the rating assigned by Fitch to JPM as issuer of the LOC. The stated expiration date of the LOC supporting the Custodial Receipts is April 30, 2020, unless such date is extended or earlier terminated. The stated expiration date of the tender option provided by JPM as tender option provider for the series 5030 PUTTERs is April 30, 2020, unless such date is extended or earlier terminated. The LOC supports the payment of principal and interest on the custodial receipts deposited in the trust in addition to payments due upon a mandatory tender event under the custody agreement. The tender option provides for the payment of the principal component of purchase price of tendered PUTTERs plus an amount equal to 185 days of interest calculated at a maximum rate of 1.635% based on a 365 day year for tendered PUTTERS in the event that the proceeds of a remarketing of the PUTTERs are insufficient to pay the purchase price following an optional or mandatory tender under the standard terms and provisions of the trust agreement. The Trustee is obligated to make timely draws on the tender option provider to pay purchase price in the event of insufficient remarketing proceeds, and in connection with the expiration or termination of the tender option, except in the case of tender option termination events permitting immediate termination of the tender option. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings assigned to the DRIVERs and Custodial Receipts are based on the short-term rating that Fitch maintains on the banks providing credit enhancement. The ratings assigned to the PUTTERs are based on the short-term ratings assigned to the bank providing the credit enhancement securing the custodial receipts and tender option and will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term rating of the bank, and in some cases the long-term rating of the custodial receipts deposited in the trust.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

"SINGAPORE, Sept 5 (Reuters) - India's Bharat Petroleum CorpLtd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltdcontinue to import gasoline to plug a persistent supply gap astheir refineries undergo maintenance and upgrade to producecleaner fuels. BPCL on Wednesday bought 20,000 tonnes of gasoline for Sept.16-18 arrival at Kandla at premiums of about $4 a barrel toSingapore quotes on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis, industrysources who track the fuel said on Thursday. This has pushed its total purchases for cargoes scheduledfor a seven-month delivery period over March to September to atleast 110,000 tonnes. HPCL has a larger appetite for the fuel, buying more than155,000 tonnes for September and October, with its most recentpurchase made on Aug. 29 from Total, the sources said. HPCL also has an outstanding tender to buy another 30,000tonnes for Oct. 10-12 arrival at Visakhapatnam. HPCL had been actively seeking gasoline since December lastyear but results of its earlier buy tenders were not clear. The companies did not immediately respond to requests forcomment. India remains a gasoline exporter despite the buying spree,although its net gasoline exports between January and July thisyear have been reduced to a monthly average of 950,000 tonnescompared with 1.11 million tonnes for the same period last year,official data showed. Demand from India alone has been insufficient to drive theAsian gasoline market higher due to expanding refinerycapacities in China, where gasoline shipments in July at 1.56million tonnes were 75% higher than a year ago. The average Asian gasoline profit margin this year as ofSept. 4 was $4.12 a barrel, down nearly 45% of its value whencompared to the same period in 2018. <GL92-SIN-CRK>(Reporting by Seng Li Peng; Editing by Tom Hogue)","India's BPCL, HPCL buy more gasoline to plug supply gaps",india's bharat petroleum corpltd and hindustan petroleum corp ltdcontinue to import gasoline to plug a persistent supply gap astheir refineries undergo maintenance and upgrade to producecleaner fuels.,"india's bpcl , hpcl keep buying gasoline to plug persistent supply gap - sources"

"By Chibuike Oguh NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co reported a 23% year-on-year drop in its third-quarter, after-tax distributable profit on Tuesday, as transaction fee revenue slid amid a broader slowdown in asset sales by buyout firms chasing lofty valuations. KKR said after-tax distributable earnings - the cash available for paying dividends - fell to $388.8 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $496.7 million a year earlier. Still, KKR's after-tax distributable earnings per share of 46 cents surpassed the average analyst forecast of 42 cents per share, according to Refinitiv. Many private equity firms, including KKR, have sold fewer companies this year, even though the U.S. stock market is hovering near all-time highs, as potential acquirers balk at their valuation expectations. This has weighed on the income they generate from the lucrative fees accompanying such transactions. Blackstone Group Inc, the world's largest private equity firm, also reported a decline in its distributable earnings last week, of 8%. During the third quarter, KKR-backed U.S. entertainment and talent agency Endeavor Group Holdings postponed a plan to raise $400 million in an initial public offering (IPO) due to weak market demand for the loss-making firm - a move that hit KKR's capital markets business, which had underwritten the IPO. KKR said total assets under management climbed to $208 billion, up 7% from a year ago.

"    * Crown reverses early firming after central bank hikes rates     * CNB says one more 2018 hike is likely, but it's not a pledge   (Recasts after Czech central bank rate hike and comments)     By Sandor Peto and Jason Hovet     BUDAPEST/PRAGUE, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The crown sank to a 2-week low against the euro on Wednesday after the Czech central bank (CNB) increased its interest rates again but did not pledge another hike for the rest of the year.     It raised rates for a third straight meeting as expected, to fight inflation that is above its 2 percent target, boosted by a surge in wages in the European Union's tightest labour market.       Markets had partly priced in one more hike before 2018.     Governor Jiri Rusnok said the bank was likely to raise interest rates again this year, but had no commitment to do so.      He also said a board member who voted for stable interest rates was slightly worried that the Czech central bank was the only one in Central Europe which has swiftly raised rates.     After the rate decision and the comments, the crown  reversed a moderate early firming towards 5-month highs against the euro, and touched a 2-week low instead, at 25.695.     At 1349 GMT it was weaker by about a quarter of a percent at 25.68.     Analysts said inflationary risks would maintain the need for rate hikes. Some, however, said a less hawkish near-term path for CNB interest rates is a risk, and this might prompt the CNB pause its hikes.     The pace will continue to hinge on the crown as a stronger currency reduces inflation risks, analysts said.     One more rate hike this year remains likely, Erste analyst Jiry Polansky said in a note, adding that the crown could appreciate next year.     ""For this reason, the CNB will hike only once in 2019, in our view, because stronger exchange rate should tighten monetary conditions adequately, which in fact should imply a lower need for another interest rates increase,"" he added.        The crown's main regional peers, the zloty and the forint, meanwhile, firmed about 0.15 percent. Warsaw's blue chip stock index rose by 0.7 percent, while Prague  shed 0.3 percent.     Czech government bonds were mixed and their yield curve flattened, with the 10-year paper bid at a yield of 2.2 percent, down 2 basis points.     Polish and Hungarian bond yields traded lower by 1-3 basis points, tracking a retreat in U.S. Treasuries and Bund yields.      Hungarian bonds were supported by a well-bid, euro denominated 7-year bond sale by the country on Tuesday, even though yields in forint bonds often rise ahead of the government bi-weekly auctions. The next tender is on Thursday.     Elsewhere, Romania's leu, which outperformed its regional peers in the past half year, touched a new six-week low against the euro.

"LONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - Rafael Nadal will face sterner tests than Dudi Sela if he is to complete a third French Open/Wimbledon double this year but was impressive all the same as he bounded into round two with a 6-3 6-3 6-2 win on Tuesday. The 32-year-old Spanish second seed had not played a match since claiming his 11th French Open last month. But he showed no sign of rust on a sultry Centre Court as he quickly found his rhythm against the 127th-ranked Israeli who resisted well early on before Nadal seized control. A Sela double-fault secured Nadal the break of serve he needed in the first set and Nadal moved two sets clear with a punishing forehand return. His only blemish came at the start of the third when a double-fault gave Sela a break but he quickly repaired the damage and powered on to victory. Nadal is looking to emulate his 2008 and 2011 feats when he won the Wimbledon title fresh from triumphing in Paris. Only Bjorn Borg has managed it three times, his doubles coming in successive years from 1978-1980.

"(Reuters) - Advertising by personal injury lawyers – or by legal marketing firms working on their behalf – is a perennial grievance of the tort reform crowd. This week, the American Tort Reform Association issued a report claiming that trial lawyers and legal marketing firms trolling for mass torts clients spent about $186 million on broadcast ads just in the second quarter of 2018. Since much of the advertising targets pharmaceutical products with allegedly dire side effects, you frequently hear groups sympathetic to the pharmaceutical industry argue that trial lawyer ads cost lives: Patients see lawyers’ ads, stop taking their medications and, according to tort reform assertions, suffer the consequences. There’s scant unbiased evidence of this phenomenon, as I told you in a column last year about a House Judiciary Committee hearing on trial lawyer advertising. The one study that claimed to have found actual patients stopped taking medication – the blood thinner Xarelto - in response to trial lawyer ads was sponsored by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which makes Xarelto. But a new paper co-authored by University of Oregon law professor Elizabeth Tippett, a key witness at last year’s congressional hearing, offers some empirical evidence that drug injury ads by trial lawyers and legal marketing firms do, in fact, mislead some consumers. And when those ads are deceptively framed as health warnings, Tippett and her co-author found, patients are less likely to refill or renew prescriptions. “This finding is concerning because it suggests that after viewing drug injury advertisements that appear to be public health warnings consumers may decide to avoid taking the featured medication,” the paper said. “Deceptive drug injury advertisements are likely to be misidentified and serve to increase the perceived risks associated with the medications they feature.” Tippett and co-author Jesse King of Weber State University conducted two studies, the results of which were posted to the Yale Journal of Health Policy, Law, and Ethics. In one, they sought to distinguish the impact of forthright and “deceptive” ads by showing about 370 consumers two actual ads about the reflux drug Reglan. One of the ads purported to be a public service warning about the drug’s side effects. The other was a more transparent pitch for prospective plaintiffs to contact a law firm. Some consumers were instructed the ads were pro-consumer. Others were told ad sponsors had a profit motive. The study found that uninformed consumers were more likely than those who received the profit-motive instruction to say they would not refill a prescription for the drug. “Providing information about the purpose of these advertisements was found to increase the likelihood that participants would seek additional information about the medication and to reduce the perceived likelihood of experiencing the primary side effect discussed in the advertisements,” the paper said. “Both of these effects are encouraging.” In the second study, the researchers wanted to test the corrective impact of pharmaceutical ads on consumers who have seen drug injury ads from trial lawyers and marketing firms. The experiment, which involved ads for the antidepressant Paxil, showed once again that consumers who view ads framed as public health warnings are likely to perceive greater risk from the targeted drug. The corrective pharma company ad did somewhat reduce the impact of the deceptive ad, the study found. The big takeaway from the two experiments, according to the paper, is that consumers can be tricked by drug injury ads that look like health warnings. “Ad content can have a marked difference in how consumers process the persuasive content of messages and ultimately on their behavioral intentions,” the professors said. They recommended stepped-up enforcement to mitigate the impact of the deceptive ads. The sort of disclaimer the American Medical Association has called for, the professors said, might help, but their studies found that even a prominent disclaimer “did not mitigate the influence of the deceptive ad on behavioral intentions towards filling a prescription.” Instead, the professors suggested that state bar associations get more aggressive about policing deceptive injury ads from lawyers. Historically, there’s no disciplinary precedent on deceptive ads, the paper said, in part because neither competitors nor consumers have brought complaints. (Competitors don’t want to put a crimp in their own advertising and deceived consumers typically don’t pay close attention to ad sponsors.) But state bars, they said, could “take the initiative to identify the worst offenders and take action against them.” Even the threat of bar discipline, they acknowledged, wouldn’t stop deceptive ads by legal marketers that don’t practice law. Thorough regulation of deceptive drug injury ads, the professors said, would require help from the Federal Trade Commission, which has power over companies beyond the reach of state bar disciplinary committees. The profs’ final word: The debate over drug injury advertising needs more study and more facts. Amen to that.

"(Adds background) WASHINGTON, April 9 (Reuters) - The White House is expected to announce soon formation of a second coronavirus task force, this one devoted to getting the U.S. economy going again when the time is right, a senior administration official said on Thursday. Trump said earlier this week that he was considering the idea as he ponders when to bring back greater economic activity and rebound from a virus-induced collapse in the economy that has left millions jobless. The task force is expected to include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow, among others, the official said. Trump's original task force, which includes health experts Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, is devoted to slowing the spread of the virus and finding drugs to treat the illness and a vaccine. They are expected to have input on any decision on when broader economic activity should resume. Trump, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, is eager to bring the economy back to life and said on Wednesday he would like to have a ""big bang"" reopening but that it might have to be done in phases, starting in areas with fewer infections. Kudlow said on Tuesday it was possible to resume economic activity in four to eight weeks.

"By David Lawder WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A U.S.-China currency agreement being floated as a symbol of progress in this week's trade talks between the world's two largest economies would largely repeat past pledges by China, currency experts say, and will not change the dollar-yuan relationship that has been a thorn in the side of President Donald Trump. Such a deal would, however, provide the U.S. Treasury an opportunity to climb down from what currency experts say was a misguided declaration in August that Beijing was a ""currency manipulator,"" reducing the yuan's value to gain ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade."" Little is known about the structure of a currency deal that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said American and Chinese negotiators were working toward on Thursday in their first high-level trade talks since July, but it is widely expected to include a promise from both to sides to refrain from devaluing their currencies to gain a competitive trade advantage. As members of the Group of 20 major economies, both the United States and China agreed to such language starting in 2010. At that time, China was widely seen to be deliberately holding down the value of its heavily managed currency, also known as the renminbi (RMB). But this intervention shifted to mainly prop up the yuan's value after a sharp devaluation in 2015. It is unclear how a pact with the United States might change Beijing's behavior. ""In essence, I don't see anything in a currency deal that will cause a significant change in the present RMB/dollar currency market dynamics,"" said Mark Sobel, a longtime former Treasury and International Monetary Fund official who is now U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a London-based think tank. Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said a currency deal would likely be accompanied by the United States' canceling a planned tariff increase to 30% from 25% on $250 billion in Chinese imports. A U.S. official confirmed that currency would likely be discussed in the talks, but it was premature to say whether an announcement would be made on the issue this week. Optimism over the talks had improved after the first day's negotiations wrapped up. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a principal negotiator in the talks along with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, said as early as February that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He had largely agreed to currency language. But talks on a broader deal to end the trade war between the United States and China broke down in May, leaving the currency provisions in limbo. YUAN STABILITY Mnuchin has long pushed his Chinese counterparts for increased transparency in yuan market interventions by China's central bank and to maintain a stable yuan value against the dollar. In August, after the yuan fell below the psychologically important level of 7 to the dollar in response to a new round of U.S. tariffs, the Treasury Department declared China a currency manipulator for the first time in 25 years following Trump's own tweets that China was manipulating the yuan. The designation under a 1988 law requires the Treasury to enter into negotiations with the offending country to correct the situation -- an effort that had been under way for more than two years. The International Monetary Fund disagreed with the designation, arguing that the yuan's value was in line with China's trade-battered fundamentals. Beijing had actually been spending reserves to prop up the yuan's value, not push it down to make exports cheaper. Eswar Prasad, former head of the IMF's China department and now a trade professor at Cornell University, said it would be convenient time for both sides to agree on the need for maintaining a stable dollar/yuan value -- even though this goes against longstanding U.S. demands that China allow its currency to float freely. If so, the United States would get an assurance that yuan devaluation would not undermine its tariffs, while China would reduce the risk of capital outflows from perceptions that it is trying to weaken the yuan, he said. ""This issue could give both sides cover to strike a mini deal that has little substance but de-escalates tensions at least temporarily, which could stabilize market sentiment and have some positive effects on both economies,"" Prasad said. CURRENCY REPORT An agreement could also allow the Treasury to declare that its manipulator designation on Beijing had been resolved. The Treasury will need to address the designation in its semi-annual currency report, due on Tuesday. Mnuchin has said that currency provisions in the new U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement represent a model for future trade deals, although these were not repeated in a newly signed limited trade deal with Japan. The USMCA language closely tracks the G20 language. The North American trade deal, which still needs ratification by the U.S. Congress, requires the three countries to disclose monthly data on international reserve balances and intervention in foreign exchange markets, along with quarterly balance-of-payments data and other public reporting to the IMF. ""If China publishes intervention data and is more transparent about its currency practices, that's a positive,"" said Sobel of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, although he noted that China already publishes reserves data, which show that it has not intervened to prevent the yuan from rising for years.

"(Refiles to fix dropped text in the lead) * Delays coincide with new A321neo ACF jet version -sources * Hamburg plant struggles to absorb resurgent engine deliveries * Airbus ""needs to deliver 76 single-aisles"" a month this quarter * Eyes output capacity of 65 single-aisles a month by end-2019 * No decision on whether to increase current target of 60/month * By Tim Hepher PARIS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - For two years Airbus faced a shortage of engines and had to slow jet deliveries. Now engines are arriving fast - but fresh snags mean a Hamburg plant that assembles best-selling jets is having trouble absorbing them, industry sources said. The internal snags have exacerbated delivery delays that leave Airbus with the challenge of delivering 76 single-aisle planes per month in the last quarter, according to consultants Flight Ascend, 9.6 percent more than its previous record. Airbus is working flat out to maintain this year's target of 800 total aircraft deliveries needed to meet financial goals and single-aisle assembly lines are its most important cash cow. ""They're late; everyone is mad at them. They've been hiding behind the engine problems,"" a senior aircraft buyer said, referring to the tendency of supply chains to focus on the most visible laggards without always tackling problems in waiting. Other industry sources say Hamburg may not be the immediate source of the problem, but that this facility has felt the worst impact in Airbus's global jigsaw of assembly plants because it is introducing a new version of A321 just as production is running faster than ever. That illustrates a wider challenge as planemakers struggle to introduce new models and fix technical issues without pausing record output increases – a task some compare to taking the steepest hill in a cycle race at a sprint while fixing a tyre. Deliveries of the A321, a large single-aisle jet mainly made in Germany, spiked higher in May as delayed engines started coming in but slowed down again in September, Airbus data shows. Now, Airbus is introducing a new A321neo ACF version, which offers more flexible cabins but requires complex configuration. One of the sources said the Hamburg assembly plant was facing some problems with cabling the jets, stirring memories of cabling problems which plagued the A380 superjumbo a decade ago. Airbus had no immediate comment. The ramp-up has also increased quality problems, leading to more delays and a queue of undelivered jets, Reuters reported last month. OIL PRICE SQUEEZE Despite disruption, Airbus has said it is confident it will meet single-aisle production goals of 60 a month spread across all its factories in mid-2019, up from around 55 now. Sources say Airbus is also preparing to make capacity of 65 single-aisle jets a month available by the end of next year, though there has been no decision on whether to implement this. Ultimately, Airbus aims to raise output as high as 70-73 to serve record travel demand and the company says planes offering premium seats like the A321neo ACF will help to drive this. Still, delays at Hamburg are a headache for new sales chief Christian Scherer as airlines wait for deliveries. For many airlines, the financial pain is acute since oil prices have bounced back to $80 dollars: exactly the market the A321neo and similar fuel-saving models were designed for. ""Airlines can deal with planes that are off-spec but not ones that are late. They have built a network plan which takes account of new aircraft in the fleet,"" Ascend chief consultant Rob Morris said. Boeing has also had some delays. Hamburg's woes highlight the operational issues at stake as planemaking chief Guillaume Faury prepares to become chief executive in April. His two main industrial lieutenants, Tom Williams and Didier Evrard, retire at end-year. Insiders say Faury, who has made production the ""priority of priorities"" for this quarter, will not be replaced as president of commercial jets but may appoint an operations leader.

"* ASX benchmark index falls about 4% in early trade * Financials, healthcare stocks weigh on ASX200 * New Zealand stock index declines nearly 3% By Aby Jose Koilparambil March 10 (Reuters) - Australian stocks plunged into bear market territory on Tuesday, as rising economic risks from the fast-spreading coronavirus and a recent plunge in oil prices clouded the global economic outlook. The S&P/ASX 200 index fell as much as 3.9% to its lowest since Dec. 27, 2018, before cutting losses to trade 0.7% lower at 5,720.60 by 0021 GMT on bargain-hunting. At the session low, the index was down more than 23% from a record high hit in February. ""I think there is a little bit of bargain-hunting around. Yesterday was a pretty brutal day, so people are happy to breathe a sigh of relief,"" said Henry Jennings, a senior analyst and portfolio manager at Marcustoday Financial Newsletter. Fears of a global recession due to the coronavirus outbreak coupled with a near 25% slump in oil prices on Monday have sent investors into panic mode, with Wall Street witnessing overnight its biggest one-day loss since the 2008 financial crisis. Crude prices suffered their biggest daily rout since the 1991 Gulf War in the previous session, as top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia began a price war that threatens to overwhelm global oil markets with supply. Meanwhile, the Australian government prepares a fiscal stimulus to ward off recession risks as the virus outbreak has hit confidence and consumer spending. The tally of virus cases rose to more than 80. Heavyweight financials accounted for most of the losses, with all the Big Four lenders declining in a range of 0.2% of 1.4%. Healthcare stocks fell 1.5%, pulled down mainly by benchmark major CSL Ltd and Nanosonics Ltd, both losing about 2% each. Losses in bullion stocks weighed on the metals and mining index. Gold miners Resolute Mining and Evolution Mining lost more than 6% each. ""Lots of people have been hiding in gold and when it's time to come out from under the bed, you would see a sell-off in gold as people move back into riskier equity assets as they are waiting for a buying opportunity,"" added Jennings. Diversified miner Rio Tinto, however, gained about 0.5% following heavy losses in the previous session, while top player BHP Ltd traded little changed. Energy stocks gained more than 3% on higher crude oil prices, with Cooper Energy and Beach Energy tacking on about 7% each. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index extended losses, shedding nearly 3%. Movie software maker Vista Group was the top percentage loser, declining about 10%.

"(Adds Provident response, details) May 13 (Reuters) - Non-Standard Finance Plc said onMonday it expected to reach an agreement to address concernsraised by Britain's competition watchdog during the first phaseof the review process of its proposed hostile takeover ofProvident Financial Plc.

NSF said it was in the final stage of talks with the CMA asto when it could make a filing, adding it expects to be able todo so shortly, at which point the initial period for the CMA'sfirst phase of review will begin.

"TIRANA, May 11 (Reuters) - Albanian opposition protestershurled petrol bombs at the entrance of Prime Minister Edi Rama'soffice on Saturday, after three months of demonstrations callingfor him to quit over alleged election fraud and corruption. Chanting ""We want a European Albania"", the slogan ofpro-democracy protests when the Balkan country dumped communismin 1990, they renewed the call they made since February for snappolls after their lawmakers also cut ties with parliament. Some protesters, including a group with masked faces, hurledpetrol bombs, firecrackers and paint at the entrance of thegovernment building and later at parliament. A dozen policemenand several protesters were hurt, police and reporters said. During a lull in the attacks at the premier's building,opposition Democratic Party leader Lulzim Basha said they were""determined to keep waging a bigger and more resolute battle aslong as the government was keeping Albania apart from Europe"".

"(Adds detail, charts) By Jamie McGeever and Paula Laier BRASILIA/SAO PAULO, March 9 (Reuters) - Brazilian assets plunged on Monday, with stock market trading halted after shares fell 10% and the central bank intervening in the spot currency market for the first time since November, as the global wave of selling and volatility engulfed local markets. Trading on the B3 Bolsa Brasil Balcao was interrupted for half an hour by an automatic ""circuit breaker"" triggered by the benchmark Bovespa index's 10% fall, its biggest decline since October 2008. The exchange has since resumed trading and was down 9% around midday. The steep fall, led by energy firms, miners and banks, pushed the Bovespa into bear market territory, signaling a decline of 20% or more from its peak. The index is now down 26% from its all time high of 119,593 points on Jan. 24. In dollar terms, according to Eikon, the Bovespa is now down 32.8% year to date, the steepest drop of any major equities index in the world. Declines come after Saudi Arabia decided to ramp up oil production as OPEC's supply-cut agreement with Russia collapsed, sending ripples across global financial markets already panicking about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Common shares in state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA fell as much as 22% and preferred shares fell 23.6%, the largest ever intraday fall, according to Refinitiv data. Petrobras' market value lost 81 billion reais ($17 billion) compared with Friday's close. Shares in miner Vale SA fell 10.7% and the country's largest banks, Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Banco do Brasil SA and Banco Bradesco SA, fell between 6% and 9%. Brazil's real slumped more than 3% to a new record low of 4.79 per dollar, although the central bank's auction of $3 billion in the spot market helped arrest the decline in the exchange rate, if not the level of market volatility. It was the central bank's first sale of dollar reserves since November, and followed several interventions in the FX swaps market in recent weeks worth almost $10 billion. Monetary policy director Bruno Serra said the central bank will do whatever is needed and in whatever size is needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange market, adding that Brazil's $330 billion of net reserves provides a ""robust insurance"" against external shocks.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Monterrey-November 06: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB+' Long-Term Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for five local governments in Mexico. In addition, Fitch has revised the Rating Outlooks for the governments to Negative from Stable. The issuers include: --Guanajuato, Estado de; --Aguascalientes, Estado de; --Corregidora QRO, Municipio de; --Chihuahua CHIH, Municipio de; --San Pedro Garza Garcia, NL, Municipio de. Fitch did not review the local governments' National Ratings. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Outlook revisions to Negative are due to Fitch taking the same action on the Mexican sovereign on Oct. 31, 2018. The Local Currency IDRs of the States of Guanajuato and Aguascalientes, and Municipalities of Chihuahua and San Pedro, are capped by the sovereign rating, following Fitch's opinion that a subnational in Mexico cannot be rated above the sovereign per our criteria, in recognition of a high degree of control and dependence on federal revenues. The Municipality of Corregidora is rated at the same level of the sovereign. Mexico's Negative Outlook reflects the deteriorating balance of risks confronting the sovereign credit profile and the scope of policy uncertainty and deterioration under the incoming administration. The Negative Outlook also reflects growing risks for contingent liabilities for the sovereign from Pemex, against a background of persistent economic under-performance relative to peers. The full rating action commentary can be found at www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/10050514. The credit strengths and weaknesses for all five issuers remain the same. RATING SENSITIVITIES A downgrade of the sovereign rating could result in a downgrade of the ratings of the five local governments. However, a stabilization of the Outlook on the sovereign rating could stabilize the Outlook on the ratings for the local governments.

The international team won by more than a minute over a pole-setting Mazda with five-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon of New Zealand, Dutchman Renger van der Zande and Australia's Ryan Briscoe sharing the driving with Kobayashi, a former Formula One driver. ""Two times, two wins. It's amazing,"" said Kobayashi, who claimed the 2019 title with twice Formula One champion Fernando Alonso, Jordan Taylor and Van Der Zande in a rain-shortened race. This time Kobayashi was behind the wheel for the closing laps. ""Wayne brought me the best car ever I drove... It's a fantastic feeling."" The team, with excellent weather conditions, completed a record 833 laps to break the previous mark of 808 set two seasons ago. They also overcame what could have been a costly error by Briscoe, who drove through a red light on the pit lane that resulted in a penalty that dropped him from the lead to a lap down. But Briscoe regained the lead lap under the fifth full-course caution. NASCAR champion Kyle Busch made his debut in the race but his team struggled in the GT Daytona class.

"* Number eight Pocock fails fitness test on Friday * Ashley-Cooper, Beale omitted for breach of protocol * Australia have won four of their 12 tests in 2018 (Adds details, quotes) LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Australia have suffered significant disruption after their breakdown master David Pocock was ruled out of Saturday's final November international against England at Twickenham and two players were not considered for a breach of team protocol. Pocock injured his neck in the 26-7 victory over Italy last weekend but was named to start against England by coach Michael Cheika on Thursday. The number eight has since failed a fitness test and will be replaced by Pete Samu who was initially named on the bench. Cheika also confirmed on Friday that experienced winger Adam Ashley-Cooper and centre Kurtley Beale had not been considered for the test following what he described as a ""minor incident"". Local media reported that Ashley-Cooper invited his sister-in-law and two friends to his hotel room after the 9-6 loss to Wales a fortnight ago. ""There's different times where we bring our families into the hotel and things like that but this was different,"" Cheika told reporters. ""Even though there's nothing sinister, I still think the rules are rules, the team law is the team law and I think that's where we've got to go. ""We've got to make this team better and stop making the small excuses, 'I didn't understand that that would be, I thought that would be okay,'. ""I feel a little bit for the guys that it is out in the public. But they’ve done nothing to hurt anybody else. ""They’ve let their team mates down in this instance, for sure, and that’s where it should lay but I understand that’s not the world we live in anymore."" Pocock is recognised as among the best ""fetchers"" in world rugby, turning over opposition ball at rucks and breaking their momentum on attack. His loss will be greatly felt by the Australians, who have won only four of their 12 tests in 2018. ""Dave pushed himself really hard to get in contention to go, as he always does,"" captain Michael Hooper said. ""He puts his body in such great condition. To not get there this time is disappointing for him and the team. ""I’ve got more than enough faith in Pete to come in. He’s been a real Mr Fix It in those roles and he’s come up with some really good plays."" Pocock, who took a year out from international rugby in 2017, has been nursing a neck injury for most of the season which forced him out of Australia’s home Rugby Championship test against South Africa in September. He has been playing in the number eight position to accommodate Hooper on the flank, but has won the majority of his 77 caps on the side of the scrum.

"By Duncan Miriri NAIROBI, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Hundreds of mismanaged infrastructure projects have stalled in Kenya and it will cost around $10 billion to revive them, the IMF said in a report whose findings point to a growing power struggle at the heart of government. Amid mounting public anger over ballooning state debt and a series of graft scandals, President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday confirmed acting finance minister Ukur Yatani in the post after its previous incumbent, Henry Rotich, was charged with financial misconduct - an accusation he denies. The government has acknowledged that some past investment projects did not pass muster, and Yatani told a budget preparation meeting on Wednesday that available resources would be ""dedicated only to projects and programmes that will ensure higher economic and social returns."" Yatani, an ally of Kenyatta while Rotich was closer to Deputy President William Ruto, has won support from voters since provisionally taking over at the ministry in July. The International Monetary Fund report, published on Wednesday, lays bare the scale of the task Yatani now faces. It said an estimated 500 projects - around half of the total - had ground to a halt due to ""non-payment to contractors, insufficient allocation of funds to projects, and litigation cases in court."" The state would need to raise around 1 trillion shillings ($10 billion) to complete them, the report said. Kenya has ramped up public investment projects since 2010. But that increase ""occurred without enough screening for project viability and readiness before they entered the budget,"" the IMF said. ""There has been a subsequent squeeze on ongoing projects in the absence of fiscal space, which is now accruing large costs to the government."" The fund named no specific projects, but construction of roads, markets and stadiums has stalled all over the country. Unpaid bills from the infrastructure department to suppliers and contractors totalled 78 billion shillings as of June, the IMF said. Yatani said the government was reconstituting its planning and project monitoring unit to ""ensure timely completion of projects and realisation of value for money."" His confirmation as finance minister was part of a government reshuffle that adds to signs of a rift between Kenyatta, who must step down when his second five-year term finishes in 2022, and Ruto, who considers himself the heir apparent but has begun to fall out of favour.

"* Prices fell sharply after production quotas ended * Cristal Union CEO expects M&A activity next year By Maha El Dahan  and Dahlia Nehme DUBAI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The European Union's sugarindustry needs to consolidate to contend with the sharp fall inprices since the end of production quotas in 2017, the chiefexecutive of French producer Cristal Union said on Monday. The sector responded to the end of quotas by boostingproduction, adding to an already oversupplied global market andtriggering a decline in prices. The market's woes were highlighted last month by Suedzucker, Europe's largest sugar refiner, announcing plans toclose two German plants as part of a restructuring programme. Cristal Union's Alain Commissaire told Reuters on thesidelines of the annual Dubai sugar conference that the sevenbig companies in Europe may be too many, adding that othersectors such as starch had fewer major players. ""We want to be part of the consolidation,"" he said. Seven companies account for the bulk of sugar production inthe European Union: Suedzucker, Tereos, Nordzucker, BritishSugar, Pfeifer and Langen, Cristal Union and Royal Cosun. Commissaire said that some of the leading companies were notmaking money with sugar but had larger turnover in otheractivities so could consider selling sugar operations. ""You can say that everyone is watching everyone and evenmore so when some of us are in difficulties ... The next two orthree years will be very interesting,"" he said. Commissaire said Cristal Union was experiencing a difficultfinancial year and would be ""in the red"". ""But that’s not so important because we are in goodfinancial shape,"" he added. ""There is no problem for us to havethis kind of situation for one year, two years."" Commissaire said he was not sure if there would be anymergers in 2019 but expects increased activity in 2020.(Reporting by Reporting By Maha El Dahan and Dahlia NehmeWriting by Nigel HuntEditing by David Goodman)",EU sugar industry needs consolidation -Cristal Union,the european union's sugar industry needs to consolidate to contend with the sharp fall inprices since the end of production quotas in 2017. cristal union's alain commissaire told reuters on thesidelines of the annual dubai sugar conference that the sevenbig companies in europe may be too many. commissaire said some of the leading companies were notmaking money with sugar but had larger turnover in otheractivities so could consider selling sugar operations.,interview-european sugar industry needs to consolidate -  cristal union ceo
"By Annie Banerji and Hugo  Greenhalgh KARNAL, India(Thomson Reuters Foundation) - FollowingIndia's September move to scrap a colonial-era ban on gay sex,more and more corporations are opening their doors to LGBT+people and ushering in policies to make them feel more welcome. But smaller firms across industries - textile houses,printing presses, rubber manufacturers, real estate agencies andothers - are not racing to diversify just yet. At a dusty roadside eatery in northern Haryana state, BabuRam Bhoshne and six of his workers burst into laughter at theidea of hiring lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people andintroducing LGBT+ policies at their workplace. ""Do I want to run my business or do I want to keep worryingabout these people flirting with my waiters,"" said themustachioed 62-year-old, laughing at the cash register, withpictures of Hindu gods and godesses on the wall behind him. ""If I have kinnars (transgender women) and (gay) men walkingaround, I will lose all my customers. They are not ready forsuch things,"" Bhoshne said, adding that his restaurant is mostfrequented by truckers, farm laborers and local villagers. Experts say such homo- and transphobic comments are notsurprising in India, which despite making great economicstrides, remains a largely conservative country wherehomosexuality and premarital sex are still frowned upon. And most of India's 60 million small and medium-sizedenterprises - which contribute nearly 30 percent to the nationalGDP - are in rural areas, according to government data. Bhoshne's Goldy Vaishnav restaurant was one of more than adozen small firms the Thomson Reuters Foundation visited, withmost owners unaware of or uninterested in gay- or trans-friendlypolicies such as health insurance for same-sex couples. Ashok Row Kavi, a prominent LGBT+ rights activist, said thatwhen most firms, including those in cities and satellite towns,continue to struggle with a wide gender gap, expectingLGBT-friendly policies in smaller ones was ""far-fetched."" ""There are no women in these places, so from where would youget LGBT+ (people) in? If there is an effeminate boy, he's inbig trouble. And they won't employ trans (people) for heaven'ssake,"" Kavi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""It won't happen until we accept that the system has gonewrong, that there is a toxic masculine atmosphere all over, anduntil we learn through the education system to change it,"" saidKavi, chairman of Mumbai-based charity Humsafar Trust. GREAT BUSINESS SENSE India is home to nearly 56 million LGBT+ adults, accordingto Paris-based firm Out Now Consulting, a marketing company thathelps businesses target gay clients. Yet the LGBT+ marketremains largely untapped, mainly due to discrimination. That is why large Indian companies are rushing to changepolicies to include gender-neutral bathrooms, insurance forsame-sex couples, leave for sex reassignment surgeries andsensitizing employees. They are finding growing resonance after gay relationshipswere decriminalized in the world's largest democracy, saidParmesh Shahani, head of the Godrej India Culture Lab, whichencourages Indian companies to adopt LGBT-friendly policies. ""Corporate India has realized that whichever way you look atit - from an economic or talent perspective - everyone wants tohire millennials and for them, being inclusive really matters;they won't work for homophobic companies,"" he said. The World Bank estimates that homophobia costs India $31billion a year. While Shahani said he does not see rural or even urban Indiabecoming fully inclusive any time soon, he was hopeful thatsmall businesses would follow in the footsteps of the corporateworld, ""otherwise they're not going to get the brightest minds."" Mumbai-based conglomerate Godrej and a handful of others,such as Tata and the Lalit Hospitality Group, have long offeredLGBT+ benefits and workplace support despite the colonial-eralaw banning homosexuality, with the rest catching up now. ""As a business owner, I think it's very important to havethese policies, which for me make great business sense,"" saidKeshav Suri, whose family owns the Lalit hotel chain. Reports, including from Accenture and the Brunswick Group,show that inclusive policies result in benefits such as greaternational GDP, talent retention, more productivity and a betterreputation that can lead to direct investments. WILLING, BUT NOT YET Not all small businesses are against diversifying. Three ofthose the Thomson Reuters Foundation visited were on board, butsaid the time was not right because of problems ranging from alack of financial resources to fear of backlash from workers. ""It has never even crossed my mind. In the past 25 years ofrunning this business, no such case has come up. I don't thinkany of my workers are (LGBT+),"" said Rajiv Mehtani, owner ofIndo Farm Implements in Haryana's Karnal district. ""It doesn't matter if someone is gay or transgender as longas the job gets done ... We have to evolve with the times, butnot immediately."" As Mehtani got up to take a phone call, one of his companysupervisors, who refused to give his name, said: ""No way, suchthings are never going to happen here. There is no need or spacefor such people - men do all the work here."" Gaurav Kaushik, who owns Bharat Polymer, a small companythat sells irrigation pipelines to farms, said: ""I am happy toemploy (LGBT+ people), but nobody is openly gay around here(because) word travels fast and consequences are usually high."" Outside cities, coming out has risks - from so-called ""honorkillings"" to corrective rape, which are seldom reported as theyare often carried out by husbands, brothers and fathers in a bidto 'cure' gay women, rights groups say. Kavi said the violence LGBT+ people face is often from theirown families, who beat them to make them conform and maintainthe social balance. To escape the beatings and find a sense of belonging, LGBT+people flock to cities, and increasingly - with the internet andsocial media easing migration for jobs and gay marriage - manyleave India altogether. Shubha Chacko, executive director of Solidarity Foundation,which helps transgender people find jobs, suggested industrylobbying groups hold seminars outside metropolitan areas andengage with small firms to bring in tailor-made LGBT+ solutions. But for Jaswant Singh, owner of a mustard oil company,LGBT-friendly policies are intrusive and best not to beintroduced at work. ""Why should I bring in something that may make my employeesfeel pressured to reveal their sexual orientation,"" 30-year-oldSingh said. ""That is their business and I am here to mind mine.""",Mind your own business: Small firms opt out as India Inc races to be LGBT-friendly,"more and more corporations are opening their doors to lgbt+people and ushering in policies to make them feel more welcome. but smaller firms across industries -  textile houses,printing presses, rubber manufacturers, real estate agencies andothers - are not racing to diversify just yet. most owners unaware of or uninterested in gay - or trans-friendlypolicies such as health insurance for same-sex couples.",feature-india's small businesses slow to embrace lgbt + policies as big firms race to diversify
"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Chicago-January 25: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratingsassigned to the $350 million series 2017-1 and $400 million series 2018-1 issuedby BIB Merchant Vouchers Receivables Limited at 'A-'. The Rating Outlook remainsStable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release. The transaction is backed by future flows due from Visa International ServiceAssociation (Visa) and MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard)related to merchant vouchers acquired by BAC International Bank, Inc. (BIB) inPanama. Fitch's ratings reflect timely payment of interest and principal on aquarterly basis. KEY RATING DRIVERS Originator's Credit Quality: The rating of this future flow transaction is tiedto the credit quality of the originator, BIB. BIB's Issuer Default Rating (IDR)is in line with the IDR of the bank's parent, Banco de Bogota (Bogota;BBB/Stable), and reflects the support BIB would receive from Bogota, ifnecessary. Additionally, Fitch's opinion considers BIB's importance as theholding company of Bogota's operation in Central America. The entity's viabilityrating (VR) continues to be affected by downward trends in BAC/Credomatic'soperating environments, primarily Costa Rica. Going Concern Assessment (GCA) Score: Fitch uses a GCA score to gauge thelikelihood that the originator of a future flow transaction will stay inoperation throughout the transaction's life. Fitch assigns a going concernassessment score (GCA) score of 'GC1' to BIB, based on the bank's strategicimportance to its parent, Banco de Bogota, as well as to the Panamanian bankingsystem. The score allows for a maximum of six notches above the Local-CurrencyIDR of the originator; however, additional factors limit the maximum uplift. Notching Uplift from IDR: Although the maximum notching uplift of the futureflow ratings from BIB's IDR is initially defined by the GCA score, Fitch limitsuplifts for 'BBB' category originators to two or three notches. Fitch alsotempers notching differential when the IDR of the financial institution isdriven by parent support. Strength of Merchant Voucher Program: BIB enjoys a market leading and profitableregional credit card business that drives group banking activities. The companyowns the only regional network that processes all major brands and is thelargest regional acquirer with a dominant market share. Diversified and Robust Flows: Securitized merchant vouchers are diversified byboth international and domestic flows, limiting certain industry exposures.Considering both series, flows are expected to support an average quarterly debtservice coverage ratio (DSCR) of 12.1x throughout the life of the program. Thisratio considers average rolling quarterly flows (over the last reported 12months reported) and the maximum quarterly debt service for both series over thelife of the program. Future Flow Debt Size:  At the end of December 2018, BIB's consolidated futureflow debt (including BIB's outstanding series, Credomatic InternationalCorporation's merchant voucher programs, and Banco BAC San Jose's diversifiedpayment rights program) represented approximately 6.3% of consolidatedliabilities and 35.4% of non-deposit funding.  While Fitch considers theseratios small enough to differentiate the credit quality of the transaction fromthe originator's Long-Term IDR, the future flow debt size is a constraint on therating limiting the rating to two notches. Low Diversion Risk: Fitch believes diversion risk is mitigated by consent andagreements (C&As) obligating Visa and MasterCard to make payments into acollection account controlled by the trustee. Stable Sovereign Environment: Panama's 'BBB' Long-Term IDR with Stable Outlookis supported by its strong, stable macroeconomic performance, which has resultedin a sustained rise in per capita income, and reflects policies and a strategiclocation and asset (the Panama Canal) that underpin a high investment rate. No Lender of Last Resort: Panama's economy is dollarized and lacks a true lenderof last resort. Nonetheless, certain mechanisms are in place to help fend off abanking system crisis. Experience in Credit Card Securitizations: BIB, through its wholly ownedsubsidiary, Credomatic International Corporation (CIC), has a strong trackrecord with merchant voucher transactions, having established two existingprograms that have issued seven different times. Debt service on past andexisting issuances has always been paid on a timely basis. RATING SENSITIVITIES The transaction ratings are sensitive to changes in the credit quality of BIB,its parent Bogota, and of BIB's underlying subsidiaries, primarily BAC San Jose.A one notch downgrade to these ratings could result in a downgrade to the futureflow program. Additionally, changes in Fitch's view of the bank's viabilityrating could lead to a negative rating action on the notes. The merchant voucherprograms could also be sensitive to significant changes in the credit quality ofVisa or MasterCard. The transaction rating is sensitive to the performance of the securitizedbusiness line. The expected quarterly DSCR is approximately 12.1x for bothseries and, therefore, should be able to withstand a significant decline in cashflows in the absence of other issues. Sensitivity analysis was performed on thestrength of collections. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch inrelation to this rating action. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcementmechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and that relateto the underlying asset pool was not prepared for this transaction. Offeringdocuments for future flow transactions do not typically include RW&Es that areavailable to investors and that relate to the asset pool underlying thesecurity.

"NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The Philippines expects economic growth to recover to 7-8 percent target next year despite global uncertainties, as it pushes ahead with massive infrastructure spending plans, the country's budget secretary said on Wednesday. Benjamin Diokno said the gross domestic product (GDP) growth would be back to targeted level next year, mainly bolstered by President Rodrigo Duterte's $180-billion infrastructure building campaign. ""We are confident that we would be back on track next year,"" Diokno told Reuters. ""We are very positive that our ""Build, Build, Build"" program will sustain growth of around 7 percent for the next 10 years."" In the second quarter, annual growth slowed to a near three-year low of 6.0 percent, leaving it set to undershoot the government's target of 7-8 percent for this year. The International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank have trimmed their 2018 growth forecasts for the Philippines. The IMF expects 6.5 percent expansion while the ADB foresees 6.4 percent. The weak peso has also helped lift inflation, which in September reached a near-decade high of 6.7 percent. Diokno said the current high inflation was ""transitory"" and was mainly driven by high oil prices. Citing the IMF and ADB forecasts, he said the inflation would reach targeted level of 2-4 percent next year. Speaking to Reuters in a separate interview, Diwa Guinigundo, deputy governor of Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas, the country's central bank, said the peso's fall to near 13-year lows against the U.S. dollar was due to global factors including U.S. interest rate hikes and the U.S.-China tariff war. ""I think our currency has some fundamental bases to remain stable and strong,"" he said. The deputy governor also said that monetary policy had a "" very strong tightening bias"" aimed at bringing inflation down to a 2-4 percent target range.

"WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday announced a new director for the U.S. government's prison system, seeking to impose stability on an agency that has been under scrutiny since the August suicide of financier Jeffrey Epstein in a New York City jail. Barr said he would appoint Michael Carvajal as director of the Bureau of Prisons, which has struggled with staffing shortages, violence, tight budgets and other problems. Over the past year, the Bureau of Prisons has granted early release to thousands of prisoners under the First Step Act and prepared to resume executions after a 16-year hiatus. Carvajal replaces Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, a veteran administrator who was brought in to run the system on a temporary basis as part of a staff shakeup that followed Epstein's suicide. The financier's death, while he was held on sex-trafficking charges, prompted multiple investigations and highlighted shortcomings in the system. Two officers were charged with falsifying records to cover up their failure to monitor him. Carvajal has risen through the ranks of the prison system since he was hired as a corrections officer in 1992. Since 2018 he has served as assistant director for correctional programs, overseeing security and emergency planning and sentence computation, among other duties. The federal system oversees 175,000 inmates, down 20% from its 2013 peak but still more than double the size of the inmate population 30 years ago.

"* Vietnamese rates rise to $350-$355/tonne from $350 * Indian rupee hits highest in over one-week * Demand muted for Thai variety- traders * Philippines may ease rice import restriction -Vietnamese trader By Sumita Layek BENGALURU, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Vietnamese rice export prices rose to a four-and-a-half-month high this week on healthy demand from Africa and Cuba as supply remained scant, while a stronger rupee helped rates for Indian variety recover from a four-month low. Rates for Vietnam's benchmark 5% broken rice <RI-VNBKN5-P1> rose to $350-$355 a tonne — a four-and-a-half month high — from $350 a tonne a week earlier due to limited stockpiles. ""Supplies are running low while demand remains steady, especially from Africa and also Cuba,"" a trader based in Ho Chi Minh City said. The Vietnamese market could get a further fillip as the Philippines, which accounts for 36% of total shipments from Vietnam, might be considering easing its restrictions on rice imports soon, another trader said. In September, prices for the Vietnamese variety had touched their lowest in nearly 12 years at $325 per tonne. In top exporter India, prices for the 5% broken parboiled variety <RI-INBKN5-P1> rose to $368-$372 per tonne from $365-$370 a week ago. The Indian rupee on Thursday hit its highest in more than a week, reducing exporters' margins. President of the Rice Exporters Association B. V. Krishna Rao, however, said, ""demand from African countries is still weak"". India's rice exports in August fell 29% year-on-year to 644,249 tonnes due to weak demand from African countries for non-basmati rice, among other factors. Neighbouring Bangladesh, meanwhile, has failed to secure any overseas deals since a long-standing export ban was lifted in May, due to cheaper rice from competitors. ""We are still looking for a market to export rice. India can export rice at $370-390 per tonne while we are asking for at least $500,"" said Shah Alam Babu, president of Rice Exporters Association. Prices in second biggest exporter Thailand's benchmark 5-percent broken rice <RI-THBKN5-P1> rose to $396-$410 a tonne on Thursday from $395-$400 last week. Traders attributed the slight rise in prices to the changes in the currency exchange rate. ""There has been very little change in demand and supply and the strengthening of the baht has moved the price up slightly,"" a Bangkok-based trader said. A stronger baht has marred demand for the Thai variety for many months now. ""If the baht weakens a little, we may be able to sell some rice, but at the moment, Thai rice is just too expensive compared with competitors,"" another rice trader said.

"(Adds latest prices, analyst comment) JOHANNESBURG, Sept 30 (Reuters) - South Africa's rand weakened on Monday, tracking the euro and other emerging market currencies, as ongoing jitters about the trade dispute between China and the U.S. and faltering euro zone growth dampened demand. At 1515 GMT the rand was 0.33% weaker at 15.1850 per dollar compared to an opening level of 15.1400. Offshore uncertainty, with reports U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges, overshadowed local developments. Unexpectedly slower German inflation and lower growth forecasts for Europe's biggest economy added to the pressure on riskier currencies like the rand. A batch of local data releases and political developments painted a mixed picture, failing to inspire rand buying. South Africa's trade balance swung to a 6.84 billion rand ($450 million) surplus in August following a July deficit of 3.72 billion rand, while President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Monday government will finalise a clear economic growth strategy within the next few weeks. On the flip side, credit demand continued to stammer, slowing to 6.86% year-on-year in August from 7.19% in July. The yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 rose 4.5 basis points to 8.34%, while stocks closed near a two-week low. The broader All-share index was down 0.7% at 54,824 points, while the Top-40 index fell 0.72% to 48,813 points, reflecting nervousness over the U.S.-China trade standoff. Shares in crisis-hit retailer Steinhoff slipped 2% to 9.80 rand after its subsidiary Steinhoff Investment Holdings said its annual results would be delayed again. ""It doesn't come as a surprise at all,"" said Wayne McCurrie, portfolio manager at FNB Private Wealth. ""Their trading results are virtually irrelevant to the share price, because they can't even quantify the extent of the litigation against them."" The index of gold stocks dropped 1.6% as investors flocked to the greenback. Bullion producer Harmony declined 3.28% to 43.30 rand, GoldFields was 2.16% lower at 76.12 rand, while shares in AngloGold fell 1.45% to 284.09 rand.

"* European stocks reach highest since October * Germany's trade sensitive DAX up 0.5 pct * Asia stocks ex-Japan at 5-month high * Trump tweets he will delay tariff increase on China * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh(Updates prices throughout; adds U.S. futures quotes) By Tom Wilson LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - World stock markets rose onMonday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would delay atariff hike on Chinese imports, buoying hopes of a resolution toa trade war between the world's two biggest economies. European stocks added 0.2 percent to touch theirhighest since October, following stronger gains by their Asianpeers. Germany's trade-sensitive DAX led the way, withthe China-exposed auto sector gaining ground. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq - both basking innine straight weeks of gains - were also set to open higher. Trump said on Sunday he would delay an increase in U.S.tariffs on Chinese goods planned for March 1 after ""productive""trade talks, adding that he and Chinese President Xi Jinpingwould meet to seal a deal if progress continued. The U.S. president cited progress in areas includingintellectual property protection, technology transfers,agriculture, services and currency. Trump's tweeted remarks offered the clearest sign yet thatWashington and Beijing are moving towards a deal to end adispute that has dragged on for months, impacting global growthand disrupting markets. The comments were set to embolden larger, risk-averseinvestors to make clear moves after weeks of guesswork on thedirection of the U.S.-Sino trade talks, analysts said. ""The people ...who previously weren't sure have come out,""said David Madden of CMC Markets. ""We could see a continuationof the upwards move (at) a more aggressive rate than we havepreviously seen it."" By mid-morning, MSCI's world equity index,which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.2 percent at itshighest since October. Dow Jones and Nasdaq futures gained 0.5 and0.7 percent respectively. Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacificshares outside Japan added 0.8 percent, touchingits highest since September. It is up 10 percent so far thisyear. Chinese blue chips scaled their highest in eightmonths on the back of a 6 percent gain, their biggest dailyincrease since July 2015. They are up nearly a quarter thisyear. The Japanese benchmark Nikkei also gained, closinghalf a percent up at its highest since December. PATIENT POWELL? A dovish shift from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has setaside rate hikes for now, has also helped. Fed Chairman JeromePowell will testify on U.S. monetary policy on Tuesday andWednesday. ""Expect him to emphasise patience, stating that any morehikes this year would likely require some pickup in inflation,""wrote analysts at TD Securities in a note. Participants in currency markets shared that sentiment. ""We expect more of the same..., with Powell generallysupportive of risky assets,"" said Adam Cole, chief currencystrategist at RBC Market. ""We think the mood of optimism and better bid for risk isprobably something we live with for the week."" The trade news was largely priced in to currency markets,with the risk-on mood nudging the dollar down 0.1 percentagainst a basket of currencies to 96.518. The euro ticked up 0.1 percent against the greenback,trading around $1.1350 and staying within the $1.1213/1.1570range that has held since mid-October. Sterling was idling at $1.3069, with markets awaitingclarity on the direction of Brexit talks. Britain's government is considering different options,including possibly delaying Brexit, if parliament fails toapprove the deal Prime Minister Theresa May struck withBrussels. The British premier on Sunday postponed a vote on the dealuntil just 17 days before Britain's scheduled March 29 departurefrom the European Union, setting up a showdown with lawmakers. In commodities, oil prices edged up towards 2019 highs onthe trade news, and as sanctions and political uncertaintytightened supply in several producer countries.

"By Benet Koleka TIRANA, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Kosovo on Wednesday raised customs tariffs on Serbian and Bosnian goods from 10 to 100 percent after Serbia blocked its former province from joining Interpol, the international police organisation. It also required authorities to remove or stop from entering any goods that did not address Kosovo by its constitutional name, Republic of Kosovo, which Serbia and Bosnia do not recognise. ""This will halt any trade between Serbia and Kosovo,"" Serbia's Trade Minister Rasim Ljajic said. President Aleksandar Vucic called a meeting of Serbia's National Security Council to review the tariffs. ""This is the biggest blow to the regional free trade zone,"" said Bosnia's Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Minister Mirko Sarovic. Bosnia, Kosovo and Serbia along with Albania, Montenegro and Moldova are part of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) set up to help ex-communist states harmonise their economic and legal systems with the demands of the European Union. According to official figures, Serbia's exports to Kosovo amounted to 440 million euros ($502.13 million), while imports amounted to 21 million euros ($23.97 million). Bosnia's exports to Kosovo reached 80 million euros ($91.22 million) last year. Two weeks ago Kosovo imposed a 10 percent import tax on goods coming from Serbia and Bosnia. The European Union has urged Pristina to reverse that decision. Kosovo's mostly ethnic Albanian population declared independence from Serbia in 2008, a decade after a NATO bombing campaign to end the killing of Albanian civilians by Serb forces during a two-year insurgency. It is now recognised by more than 110 nations but not by Serbia, Russia or five EU states. Belgrade and Moscow have blocked Kosovo from joining the United Nations. In 2013 both countries agreed to an EU-sponsored dialogue to resolve outstanding issues, but little progress has been made. Kosovo blamed a campaign by Serbia for its failure to join Interpol and said Serbia was against normalizing relations, key for both countries if they are to join the European Union. Bosnia also voted against Kosovo's membership. ""The government has decided to impose a tax of 100 percent on imported goods coming from Serbia and Bosnia,"" Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said.

"TOKYO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday that he believed the central bank will pursue appropriate policy to achieve its 2 percent price stability goal, which he reckoned would take a long time to achieve. Aso told reporters that he understood Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's view that a premature debate on ending the massive stimulus could cause market confusion. Asked about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's comment on Friday that hinted at his hope of preparing an exit from the radical stimulus programme in coming years, Aso said specific monetary policy was up to the BOJ to set.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-New York-January 08: Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA' rating tothe following Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC) revenue bonds: --$57 million utility system revenue refunding bonds, series 2019A. The series 2019A bonds are scheduled for negotiated sale the week of Jan. 14,2019. Bond proceeds will be used to refund outstanding series 2009B bonds andpay issuance costs. The bonds will not carry a debt service reserve. In addition, Fitch affirms the following ratings: --$1.5 billion in outstanding utility system revenue bonds at 'AA'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The bonds are secured by net revenues derived by the combined system. KEY RATING DRIVERS LARGE COMBINED UTILITY SYSTEM: OUC provides electric, water, chilled water andlighting services on a retail basis to a diverse, stable and economically strongservice area. OUC's vertically integrated electric utility generates the vastmajority of combined revenues, accounting for approximately 85% of totaloperating revenue in 2018. STRONG FINANCIAL METRICS: Fitch-calculated debt service coverage (DSC) andcoverage of full obligations (COFO), including a sizeable dividend payment tothe city of Orlando, have remained above 2.0x and 1.50x, respectively, for thepast several years. Liquidity has long been a credit strength with 333 days cashon hand (DCOH) in fiscal 2018. Fitch expects similar financial results tocontinue based on OUC's most recent financial forecast ending in 2023. MANAGEABLE CAPITAL NEEDS AND LEVERAGE: Capital spending is manageable andexpected to be funded from leftover bond proceeds, additional debt and internalsources. At roughly 5.7x in 2018, system leverage is expected to remain atsimilar levels over the next five years. COMPETITIVE RATES PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY: OUC's full rate setting authority andcompetitive electric and water rates provide flexibility. Available liquidityincludes robust funding of fuel and rate stabilization funds used to stabilizerates in the event of rising variable costs and/or declining sales. AMPLE POWER SUPPLY: Owned and partially owned generating assets are sufficientlydiversified by fuel mix and number of assets, and along with power purchasesprovide ample capacity to meet load growth through at least 2023. The ability topurchase power from the Florida Municipal Power Pool (FMPP) provides addeddiversification. RATING SENSITIVITIES CONTINUED SUCCESSFUL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: The rating on Orlando UtilitiesCommission's bonds reflects the expectation of continued successful managementof the resource base in light of anticipated retail demand growth coupled withthe advanced age of some of OUC's generating assets and lower wholesale salesexpected over the next few years. CREDIT PROFILE OUC is a combined utility system providing primarily electric generation,transmission and distribution service on a retail basis to customers within thecity of Orlando and surrounding portions of Orange County, FL. OUC also operatesa water production, transmission and distribution system, and provides chilledwater and lighting services. OUC's owned and partially owned generating assetsare sufficiently diversified by fuel mix and number of assets, and provide amplecapacity to meet load growth for the foreseeable future. STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONTINUES Financial performance remains strong prompted by a combination of steadycustomer growth and a return to positive growth in demand. Fitch calculated DSChas remained above 2.0x since fiscal 2013, while coverage of full obligationsaveraged closer to 1.7x over the same span. Annual transfers to the city's general fund have remained manageable, but aretrending higher. The dividend, which was previously calculated to equal 60% offixed income before contributions, will grow at a fixed annual 3% for 2019 and2020. The dividend payment is made pursuant to the bond resolution aftersatisfying annual debt service obligations as well as the payment of alloperating expenses. OUC's balance sheet remains strong. Available liquidity, which includes fuel andrate stabilization funds, moneys designated by policy only for future debtservice payments, and a robust renewal and replacement fund, provided 333 DCOHat the close of fiscal 2018. Updated financial projections provided by OUC showDSC continuing in excess of 2.0x. The forecast reflects reasonable assumptionsregarding customer and sales growth as well as additional manageable base rateincreases. The average monthly residential electric bill remains $106 assuming 1,000 kWh.Electric rates remain competitive with management's goal to maintain rates belowpeer systems. Similar to the electric system, water rates compare favorably toother regional providers with the average monthly residential bill below $20(within Orlando city limits) in 2017 assuming 10,000 gallons of use. LEVERAGE TO REMAIN MANAGEABLE OUC's debt profile has demonstrated modest improvement over the last severalyears, leaving leverage metrics solidly in line with median ratios for the 'AA'rating category. The ratio of debt to funds available for debt service (FADS)totaled 5.7x in fiscal 2018 and equity to capitalization has steadily improvedover the past few years to 46.1% in 2018. OUC expects to fund its capital program with leftover bond proceeds, existingreserves and excess cash flow. There are no specific plans to issue additionaldebt at this time but management may decide to debt-fund some portion of thecapital plan as part of its annual capital improvement plan (CIP) update.Nevertheless, Fitch expects debt and leverage will remain manageable withamortization of existing debt potentially outpacing any new debt that may beissued over the next five years. Capital needs through 2023 remain manageable with planned spending estimated atover $900 million. The CIP will focus on electric and water production anddelivery as well as routine maintenance and upgrades across both systems. OUC remains exposed to variable rate debt but the risks continue to be prudentlymanaged. After the refunding of the series 2011A's (the 2017A issuance),variable rate obligations account for a more manageable 23% of total debtoutstanding. However, the 2017A's were issued in a term rate mode and bear afixed rate of interest until Oct. 1, 2020, at which time the $98 million parwill be subject to mandatory tender. The 2011A's had an accompanying interestrate swap, which remains outstanding although the swap payments have beensuspended until the mandatory tender date. OUC plans to either redeem/refinance the 2017A bonds with long-term fixed ratedebt (and terminate the related swap) or it can allow the bonds to revert backto a variable rate and amortize over the remaining term (2027). The existingswap would be used as a hedge if this path is taken. Fitch believes OUC's likelyability to continue to access the market and its considerable balance sheetresources sufficiently mitigate the mandatory tender of the 2017A on Oct. 1,2020. The remaining two series of variable rate bonds outstanding (series 2008 and2015B) have liquidity support in the form of standby bond purchase agreementswith solidly rated liquidity providers. The agreements expire in April 2020 andOctober 2022, respectively. The series 2015B bonds are synthetically fixedpursuant to an interest rate swap agreement with Goldman Sachs Bank USA (A/F1).

"(Adds comment from Pell's lawyer, bishops) By Byron Kaye SYDNEY, Feb 26 (Reuters) - For two decades, George Pell wasthe dominant figure in the Catholic Church in Australia - a boyfrom a gold mining town whose ambition, intellect and knack forbefriending influential people propelled him to become thethird-most senior official in the Vatican. That came crashing down in December, when a court foundPell, 77, guilty of five charges of child sex offences committedin a Melbourne cathedral 115 km (70 miles) from his hometown ofBallarat. The verdict had been subject to a court order thatprevented reporting of the case until the judge lifted therestrictions on Tuesday. Pell is the most senior Roman Catholic official to beconvicted of sexual offences, bringing a rolling abuse scandalthat has dogged the church worldwide for three decades to theheart of both the Vatican and Australian civic life. Pell spent most of his first three decades as a priest inBallarat, an old gold mining town in the state of Victoria,about 120 km (75 miles) from Melbourne. State and federal inquiries would later find it to be one ofthe Catholic dioceses worst-affected by cases of abuse, thoughnone of the complaints against Pell stem from his time there. It was after Pell left his hometown to become Archbishop ofMelbourne, in 1996, that he committed offences against twochoirboys in the city's St Patrick's Cathedral for which he wasfound guilty by the 12-person jury. It was not until 2016 that the complaints against Pell werefirst made public, with charges laid in 2017, and in themeantime he continued to rise through Australia's Churchhierarchy. By the time Pell became Archbishop of Sydney, the country'stop-ranking Catholic position, in 2001 he was a polarisingnational figure – revered by many conservative Catholics butcriticised by liberals for his outspoken views. At a 2002 World Youth Day event in Toronto, Pell madeheadlines by saying ""abortion is a worse moral scandal thanpriests sexually abusing young people"" since abortion was""always a destruction of human life"". In a short statement outside the court on Tuesday, afterPell departed in a waiting car, Pell's lawyer, Paul Galbally,said: ""Cardinal Pell has always maintained his innocence andcontinues to do so."" He said an appeal had been filed. FINANCIAL ROLE In meetings among cardinals before the conclave that electedPope Francis in 2013, the Australian stood out not only for hisimposing height and broad shoulders, but also for his command offinancial matters. Hoping to end Vatican financial scandals, the pope movedPell to Rome and in 2014 he was appointed to run a new ministry,the Secretariat for the Economy. Meanwhile, in Australia, a state inquiry into institutionalabuse began airing accounts of child abuse and cover-ups inBallarat and elsewhere over generations, triggering a morepowerful, comprehensive Federal Royal Commission inquiry. Pell was not named as an alleged perpetrator at eitherinquiry. When he was called to give evidence at the RoyalCommission it was only in relation to his knowledge of others'conduct, and the question of whether he was present when churchleaders decided to move offending priests between parishes. In testimony to the commission in March 2016, Pell said thathe did not know of the sexual abuse of children in Ballarat byanother priest in the 1970s until his conviction in 1993,although the commission had heard testimony from others that thepriest's behaviour was an open secret in the diocese. ""It's a sad story and it wasn't of much interest to me,"" hetold that inquiry. Pell also said the Church made ""catastrophic""choices by minimising its response to, and covering up, abusecomplaints. When the global wave of abuse allegations reached Pell inJune 2017, some of the country's most powerful people stood byhim, including former conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott,himself a devout Catholic, who told a newspaper ""the George PellI have known is a very fine man indeed"". Pell's successor as Archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher,also told media at the time that ""the George Pell I know is aman of integrity in his dealings with others, a man of faith andhigh ideals, a thoroughly decent man"". Abbott and Fisher did not immediately respond to requestsfor comment after the verdict was made public. Mark Coleridge, president of the Australian Catholic BishopsConference, said the conviction had shocked people aroundAustralia and the world, including the bishops. ""We pray for all those who have been abused and their lovedones, and we commit ourselves anew to doing everything possibleto ensure that the Church is a safe place for all, especiallythe young and the vulnerable,"" he said in statement. Pell took leave from his Vatican finance role to fight thecharges but he still officially held that job through his trial. Pope Francis and the Vatican made no statement on the guiltyverdict when delivered in December, which was reported by someinternational media at the time, saying they would respect theAustralian legal process and suppression order. A day after the December verdict, Pell was one of threecardinals the pope removed from his group of close advisers. Noreason was given at the time. Some victims' advocates say the conviction of so highprofile a figure could encourage other survivors of clericalabuse to speak out. ""A lot of people, particularly survivors, are scared to comeforward because they think 'no one's going to believe me, thecourt's not going to believe me',"" said Philip Nagel, who wentto a Ballarat school where Pell was a priest in the 1970s andtestified against another clergyman who has since been jailed. ""Not getting justice is probably as damaging as the offencesbeing committed, so this will give more people more courage tocome forward.""(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by John Mair and AlexRichardson)",NEWSMAKER-Cardinal Pell: Dramatic fall from grace for Vatican treasurer, george pell is the most senior roman catholic official to beconvicted of sexual offences. pell is the most senior roman catholic official to be convicted of sexual offences. he committed offences against twochoirboys in the city's st patrick's cathedral in 1996.,"update 1-former australian cardinal pell , third-most senior vatican official , found guilty of child sex offences"
"By Umberto Bacchi LONDON, Oct 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A top U.N. adviser has urged the global body to put victims at the heart of its efforts to combat sexual harassment, saying it had to do more than pay lip service to zero tolerance. Purna Sen said the United Nations too often sidelined victims in favour of technocrats, citing the current practice of sharing the outcome of internal investigations only with the suspect - and not the complainant. ""This sort of inequality of treatment ... is problematic and it also doesn't serve to build confidence among victims that they are being taken seriously,"" said Sen, who was named UN Women's executive coordinator on sexual harassment in May. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said earlier this year he was concerned by reports of sexual harassment at the United Nations and promised to uphold a zero-tolerance policy. The U.N. has been rocked by dozens of cases since early 2017 as the #MeToo campaign has emboldened women to speak out against their abusers. In February, a senior official at the U.N. children's agency UNICEF resigned over inappropriate behaviour towards women in his previous role as head of Save the Children UK. ""(Victims) know what's needed, they are the experts ... second guessing what can make a difference isn't good enough,"" Sen told the Thomson Reuters Foundation during an interview in London. ""In the U.N. we are not accustomed to not being the experts."" In August an independent oversight body said U.N. agencies must improve ways for staff to report harassment, retaliation and other forms of misconduct and safeguard whistle-blowers who are prepared to reveal cases of abuse. Sen said victims had called for a more transparent system, with investigations carried out by an independent body. U.N. Women was hit by the scandal last month when it fired a senior member of staff over sexual misconduct. Media reports said he had been accused of groping and sending indecent images to younger male colleagues. Sen described the case as ""tough"" and ""painful"". ""It has shaken us,"" she said. With the #Metoo movement showing that no sector - from cinema to politics - is immune, Sen said all employers should go the extra mile to address it. Drawing up a new policy or having staff undergo a training session that can be completed while watching television do little good if women are left feeling they are not listened to and those responsible go unpunished, she said. ""Zero tolerance has to be more than an expression, it has to be a practice, and that practice has to be led by the senior leadership of an organisation,"" said Sen.

" (Adds graphics showing pct changes for LME metals in 2019 and the decade; updates prices)     BEIJING, Dec 31 (Reuters) - London copper and other base metal prices tracked Asian equity markets lower on Tuesday despite positive factory data in top metals consumer China, as investors looked to collect profits on the last day of the year.     Copper, widely used in power and construction, is on course to notch a 5.9% rise in December, which would be its best month in two years, and a 4.1% gain in 2019 on easing Sino-U.S. trade tensions, although it will end the decade sharply lower than where it began.      By far the best performer among LME metals over the past 12 months has been nickel, which has risen by around one-third and is set to log its best year since 2009, spurred by an expedited  ban on nickel ore exports from Indonesia from Jan. 1, 2020.     Both the London Metal Exchange and the Shanghai Futures Exchange will be closed on Wednesday for the New Year's Day holiday.     FUNDAMENTALS     * COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange  slipped 0.2% to $6,209 a tonne by 0430 GMT, after closing up 0.1% on Monday. The most-traded February copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.4% to 49,250 yuan ($7,059.92) a tonne by the end of the morning, but was on course for a 1.8% annual rise.      * CHILE: The world's top copper-producing country is due to report its copper output figure for November later on Tuesday.     * CHINA: Factory activity in China expanded for a second straight month in December, as Beijing's stimulus measures buoyed domestic demand and exporters cheered a trade war truce with the United States.     * TRADE: Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington this week to sign a Phase 1 trade deal with the United States, the South China Morning Post reported on Monday.      * OTHER METALS: Lead was the laggard, falling by 0.9% in London and Shanghai, while ShFE nickel was the only metal to rise, adding 0.8%. ""The market risk appetite has fallen again,"" one trader said.      * DECADE: LME copper is set to end the 2010s nearly 16% lower than where it began and nickel almost 23% lower. Only tin  has held firm in a tough decade for industrial metals.                   MARKETS NEWS         * Asian shares slipped on the last trading day of the decade, echoing falls on Wall Street, as investors locked in gains made since the United States and China reached a preliminary trade deal earlier this month.

"WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday told reporters he expects to score two legislative victories before the end of the year, on criminal justice and the major agricultural and food package commonly called the ""farm bill."" Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said that it looks like Congress will soon vote on legislation on an overhaul of U.S. prison policies and criminal sentencing standards, and that he expects it will pass with bipartisan support.

"    * Brazil to start discussions on joining OPEC in July     * Broader Latam tracks global relief rally over China virus     * Argentine bonds fall as debt deadline postponed; peso flat  (Adds market details, updates prices)     By Ambar Warrick     Jan 22 (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks and the real led gains across Latin America on Wednesday as the country looks to start discussions on joining OPEC, while most regional assets rose amid waning concerns over a Chinese virus.     Brazilian Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said Brazil will begin talks on joining the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries when he visits Saudi Arabia in July.       The country, whose crude production has expanded rapidly, would likely have to comply with OPEC supply curbs. Brazil is also poised to sign supply deals with India, one of the largest oil importers in the world.     The real strengthened 0.6% to the dollar, while Sao Paulo stocks rose 0.6%. However, shares of state-run oil firm Petrobras fell slightly.     Across Latin America, stocks and currencies rose slightly, tracking a recovery in global risk assets amid hopes that the spread of a new flu-like virus in China would be contained.      MSCI's index for Latin American equities rose 0.9%, a day after its biggest daily decline in nearly two months. The currencies index was about 0.4% higher.      Fears over economic disruptions by the Chinese virus had rattled global markets on Tuesday, although analysts downplayed the likely impact.      ""The spread of a new coronavirus across Asia and into the U.S. is clearly a major public health concern, but we suspect that its economic effects will be modest,"" said Jennifer McKeown, head of global economics at Capital Economics.     ""Even the significant economic disruption related to SARS turned out to be temporary and experts expect this disease to be less deadly and better contained.""     The Argentine peso was largely flat, while stocks  rose slightly as the provincial government in Buenos Aires was forced to extend a deadline for creditors to agree or reject a plan to delay a $250 million bond repayment originally due on Jan. 26.     Argentine sovereign and provincial bonds fell after the extension, reflecting broader concerns over the country defaulting on its debt obligations.     The Argentine peso had crashed last year due to the same concerns, and was among the worst performing emerging market currencies in 2019.     The Chilean peso firmed against the dollar after deputy central bank governor Joaquin Vial promised intervention if violent protests threatened the currency again. Vial also expressed hope that relative calm in recent weeks would be enough to keep the country out of recession.      Violent protests in the country last year had drastically undercut the peso and prompted central bank intervention to stabilize the currency.

If the CMA's concerns are not resolved, Experian's 275 million pound ($357.5 million) deal reached in March to buy ClearScore will be referred for an in-depth second round of investigation.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Sydney-December 04: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Australia-based Ergon Energy Queensland Pty Ltd's (EEQ) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating at 'AA'. The Outlook is Stable. EEQ's ratings reflect its strong linkage with its parent, Energy Queensland Limited (EQL; AA/Stable), whose rating is in turn equalised with that of the State of Queensland (AA/Stable) under Fitch's Government-Related Entities Rating Criteria. The state supplies all the long- and short-term financial requirements for EQL which provides central treasury-management services for the group. We believe the company's standalone profile is weaker than that of the state. Key Rating Drivers Strong Strategic Ties: EEQ's ratings are aligned with those of EQL under Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria. Queensland state's commitment to retain ownership of EEQ supports its strong linkages with EQL. EQL does not explicitly guarantee EEQ's obligations, but Fitch believes the links are sufficiently strong to warrant equalisation of EEQ's ratings with those of its parent. Integrated with the State: EEQ has access to funds from EQL via the group's treasury-management agreement. According to the agreement, EQL is responsible for providing central treasury-management services for the group such as the administration of the debt and cash-management facilities from the Queensland Treasury Corporation (QTC), including working-capital facilities. EQL, which is wholly owned by the state of Queensland, receives all its funding from the QTC. The virtually assured availability of perpetual senior debt from QTC indicates a high degree of financial integration with the state. State Payments Support Profile: EEQ's unsupported credit profile reflects that of a pure electricity retailer, which Fitch believes bears a high business risk. The company's credit profile, however, benefits from the community service obligation payments from the state, which compensate EEQ for the shortfall in recovering its costs as a result of the state's uniform tariff policy. Derivation Summary EEQ's ratings are equalised with that of EQL due to their strong linkages, in line with Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria. EQL's rating is equalised with the State of Queensland, according to Fitch's Government-Related Entities Rating Criteria in light of their strong linkages with the state government, which provides the company with its long- and short-term financial requirements. Its standalone and unsupported credit profile reflects that of a pure retailer, which we believe has high business risk. However, the state's community service obligation payments support the company's credit profile. Key Assumptions Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Continuation of community service obligation payments - Funding support from Queensland and QTC via parent - Revenue declines of 5% in the financial year ending June 2020 (FY20) with further falls thereafter (FY19: -1%) - EBITDA margin falling to 13% in FY20 and to 9% in FY21 (FY19: 15%) - Capex of around 1% of revenue per annum - Dividend payments to EQL, with minimal cash held at EEQ RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - Positive rating action on EQL, provided EEQ's linkages with the parent remain intact Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - Negative rating action on EQL - Any weakening in EEQ's linkages with its parent. Liquidity and Debt Structure EEQ has minimal debt. Its financial needs are met by EQL, which is funded through QTC. Public Ratings with Credit Linkage to other ratings The rating is linked to EQL's ratings under the Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

Fitch does not expect to rate the class A-2A, A-2B, B, or C notes or theInterests. TRANSACTION SUMMARY BCC Middle Market CLO 2019-1, LLC is a middle-market (MM) collateralized loanobligation (CLO) that will be managed by Bain Capital Specialty Finance, Inc.(BCSF). Net proceeds from the issuance of the secured notes, interests andincurrence of the class A-1L loans, will provide financing on a portfolio ofapproximately $500 million of primarily first lien senior secured MM loans. KEY RATING DRIVERS Asset Credit Quality: The average credit quality of the indicative portfolio is'B'/'B-', which is in line with that of recent MM CLOs. The weighted averagerating factor (WARF) of the indicative portfolio is 39.2 versus a maximumcovenant, in accordance with the initial expected matrix point, of 42.0. Issuersrated in the 'B' rating category denote a highly speculative credit quality;however, the class A-1L loans and A-1 notes (collectively, the class A-1 debt)benefit from credit enhancement of 45.5% and standard U.S. MM CLO structuralfeatures. Asset Security: The indicative portfolio consists of 95.7% first lien seniorsecured loans. The weighted average recovery rate (WARR) of the indicativeportfolio is 71.8% versus a minimum covenant, in accordance with the initialexpected matrix point, of 62.7%. Portfolio Composition: The largest three industries may comprise up to 44.5% ofthe portfolio balance in aggregate while the top ten obligors can represent upto 25.5% of the portfolio balance in aggregate. The level of diversity requiredby industry, obligor and geographic concentration is in line with other recentU.S. MM CLOs. Portfolio Management: The transaction has a 4.1-year reinvestment period andreinvestment criteria similar to other U.S MM CLOs. Fitch Ratings' analysis wasbased on a stressed portfolio with the aim of testing the robustness of thetransaction structure against its covenants and portfolio guidelines. Cash Flow Analysis: Fitch used a customized proprietary cash flow model toreplicate the principal and interest waterfalls and assess the effectiveness ofvarious structural features of the transaction. In the agency's stressscenarios, class A-1 debt can withstand default rates of up to 74.5% assumingrecoveries of 30.3%. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch evaluated the class A-1L loans and A-1 notes' (collectively, the class A-1debt) sensitivity to the potential variability of key model assumptions,including decreases in recovery rates and increases in default rates. Resultsunder these sensitivity scenarios ranged from 'BB+sf' to 'AAAsf' for the classA-1 debt.

"By Nate Raymond (Reuters) - A tentative settlement resolving whistleblowerclaims that long-term care pharmacy provider PharMerica Corpaccepted kickbacks from the drugmaker Organon in exchange forhaving Medicaid patients use its antidepressant Remeron hasfallen apart. Lawyers for two ex-employees of Organon had in a Decembercourt filing disclosed they had reached anagreement-in-principle to resolve the lawsuit that was subjectto approval of states whose Medicaid programs they said weredefrauded. But in an interview late on Wednesday, Zenobia HarrisBivens, a lawyer for ex-employees James Banigan and RichardTemplin at Berg & Androphy, said the case was no longer settlingand that her clients were moving forward with appealing ajudge's dismissal of the case. ""Sometimes things don't work out,"" she said. Her clients on Wednesday filed an appellate brief with the1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Due to confidentialinformation in it, the brief was filed under seal. A redactedversion is expected to be made public later. Bivens declined to say why the case was no longer settling.James Smeallie, a lawyer for PharMerica at Holland & Knight, didnot respond to a request for comment. Filed in 2007, the lawsuit claimed Organon violated theAnti-Kickback Statute from 1999 to 2005 by offering financialincentives to companies such as PharMerica that provide pharmacyservices to nursing homes with patients covered by Medicaid. The lawsuit said as a result, pharmacy providers PharMericaand Omnicare submitted reimbursement claims tainted by kickbacksto Medicaid, the joint federal-and-state healthcare program forthe poor and disabled. The lawsuit was filed under the False Claims Act and stateequivalents, which allow whistleblowers to sue companies on thegovernment's behalf to recover fraudulently paid-out taxpayermoney. If successful, whistleblowers can receive a reward. While the U.S. Justice Department and state attorneysgeneral can intervene in such lawsuits, in this case theydeclined. That left the ex-Organon employees to pursue it on thebehalf of the federal government, 27 states and the District ofColumbia. Any settlement would require those governments'approval. The lawsuit has already led to settlements with Organon, nowowned by Merck & Co Inc, and Omnicare, now owned by CVS HealthCorp. They agreed to pay $31 million and $23 million,respectively, leaving only PharMerica, majority owned by privateequity firm KKR, as a defendant. U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel in Boston in 2012 dismissedmost of the case as barred by a prohibition in the False ClaimsAct against lawsuits based on already public information. She based that holding on a 2002 whistleblower case raisingsimilar kickback allegations against PharMerica. Templin and Banigan later dropped other claims, leaving onlyallegations that PharMerica violated the False Claims Actequivalents of Louisiana, Michigan and Texas. Zobel dismissed those claims in May 2018, saying Templin andBanigan did qualify as original sources of information who couldpursue whistleblower claims. Zobel said both men learned of the alleged scheme from twoother Organon employees and either did not see corroboratingdocumentation until after it ended or were hired after it tookplace.","PharMerica drug kickback case no longer settling, lawyer says",lawyers for two ex-employees of organon had in a decembercourt filing disclosed they had reached anagreement-in-principle to resolve the lawsuit. a lawyer for ex-employees james banigan and richardtemplin at berg &  androphy said the case was no longer settling. her clients are moving forward with appealing ajudge's dismissal of the case.,"pharmerica , ex-organon employees drop plan to settle remeron kickback case"

"(Adds detail about law, media situation, and President's comments) * Ruling Fidesz passes law rejected by opposition * Law gives government open-ended emergency powers * Legislation has been criticised by rights groups * Justice Minister rejects accusations as ""fake news"" * President Janos Ader signs new law By Marton Dunai and Krisztina Than BUDAPEST, March 30 (Reuters) - Hungary's parliament granted nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban the right to rule by decree on Monday to fight the coronavirus, ignoring calls by opponents and rights groups to put a timeframe on the extra powers. President Janos Ader, an Orban ally, signed the legislation extending a state of emergency after it was approved by parliament, dominated by Orban's Fidesz party. Ader said it was in line with international treaties and Hungary's constitution. The law has triggered criticism from opposition parties, rights groups and the Council of Europe, Europe's main rights forum, because it does not set a specific limit on the time the additional powers will be in force. It also imposes jail terms of up to five years on those hindering measures to curb the spread of the virus or spreading false information that could upset people or hinder the fight against the virus. Rights groups said this might be used to muzzle journalists as remaining independent media are forced to cut staff and budgets while media loyal to the government continue to receive taxpayers' money. Since he took power in 2010, Orban has built media he can control, using legal levers, ownership changes and advertising money for more loyal media coverage. The economic impact of the coronavirus could accelerate the shake-up of the media, journalists say. The government has rejected the criticism, saying the law empowers it to adopt only measures needed to fight the virus, and that parliament can revoke the special powers. ""This is an authorisation limited both in time and scope ... as it is solely related to the coronavirus, and you are crying a dictatorship,"" state secretary Bence Retvari told opposition parties before the vote. Justice Minister Judit Varga said it was ""very damaging fake news"" that the law is intended to neutralise the national assembly. Orban, who has gradually increased his power in a decade in office, has often been in conflict with the European Union and rights organisations over his perceived erosion of democratic checks and balances and the rule of law. Opposition lawmakers said they back the government's overall fight against the coronavirus but wanted a time limit placed on the government's special powers, which parliament can extend if necessary. Parliament rejected all opposition amendments. President Ader said the government's special authorisation would end once the epidemic is over and was limited to dealing with the epidemic and its fallout. ""The controlling role of Parliament and the government's duty to report will remain in place during the epidemic,"" Ader said. Hungary has reported 447 coronavirus cases and 15 deaths. INDEPENDENT MEDIA AT RISK Some media companies, facing severe short-term liquidity problems, have already scrapped plans for 2020. Central Media, one of Hungary's largest media groups, has put journalists on reduced hours and cut salaries by up to a quarter, several sources told Reuters. Pesti Hirlap, a tabloid, has told staff it will cut jobs and switched to online-only mode. Executives at HVG, a weekly that also runs a popular web site, warned staff of budget cuts, according to several sources. ""Press freedom could fall victim to the coronavirus,"" Miklos Hargitai, chair of the Hungarian Journalists Association (MUOSZ), told Reuters. State media have an annual budget of around 90 billion forints ($280 million). The public media budget is not affected by the crisis this year, a government spokesman said. Loyal outlets receive state advertisements regardless of their audience size, data shows. ""The coronavirus epidemic will have a devastating effect on Hungarian independent media,"" said Agnes Urban, director of the Mertek Media Monitor think tank.

"(Adds comment from Seaborne Freight, background) LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour Partyon Monday criticised the government for awarding a 14 millionpound ($18 million) contract to a ferry company with no ships toprovide backup freight cover in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Labour's transport spokesman, Andy McDonald, said thetransport ministry had failed to carry out proper checks on thecompany, Seaborne Freight. ""The Department for Transport's claim that it carried outdue diligence is increasingly incredible given the mountingevidence of a lack of relevant expertise or experience,""McDonald said. ""Our economy depends on these trading routes continuing tofunction yet [Transport Secretary] Chris Grayling is prepared torely on amateurs in the event of a no deal,"" he said. ""A no deal scenario would be terrible for our transportnetworks under any circumstance but the sheer incompetence withwhich preparations have been handled is alarming in theextreme."" Seaborne Freight Chief Executive Ben Sharp rejected thecriticism and said the company had been working on providing aferry service for the last two years. ""Collectively, the directors and investors of Seaborne havesignificant experience in operating vessels and ferries alike -in particular ferries in the Channel,"" he told Reuters. ""Seaborne is no threat to the United Kingdom because theyare not paying us anything until we deliver. So, what is theproblem?"" Currently, Britain's EU membership means that trucks drivesmoothly through border checks within the bloc. But in a no-dealBrexit, even a few minutes' delay at customs for each truckcould mean vehicles backed up at ports and queued on feederroads on both sides of the Channel. Britain awarded contracts worth more than 100 million poundsin total to three shipping firms to provide extra ferries. Theother two are established operators - French firm BritannyFerries and Danish group DFDS.(Reporting by Jonathan Saul; editing by Guy Faulconbridge andKate Holton)",UPDATE 1-UK opposition Labour Party chides government over ferry contract,labour's transport spokesman said the transport ministry had failed to carry out proper checks on seaborne freight. seaborne freight chief executive said the company had been working on providing aferry service for the last two years.,update 1-uk labour criticises government for awarding ferry contract to ' amateurs ' for no-deal brexit cover

"* Shaw praises Mourinho for setting him on right track * Says he could have lost his leg after double break * Endured tough time afterwards and saw psychologist (adds more Shaw quotes in paras 9-13) LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - England left back Luke Shaw believes his Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho was right to criticise him and said on Tuesday the Portuguese had been key to his international recall. The 23-year-old was last week named in the England squad for the first time in 18 months for the Nations League match against Spain on Saturday and the friendly with Switzerland on Tuesday. His return to the international fold follows a strong start to the season in which he has played every minute of United's opening four games after he struggled to get into the team last term, with Mourinho critical of Shaw's attitude. ""I think he got frustrated with me because he knew I could do better,"" Shaw said on how he was treated by the United manager. ""When I look back, maybe he was right. ""It was a tough few years but it made me stronger mentally. I wanted to prove to him I could do what he said I couldn't. I had a chat with the manager before the season and he said he wanted me to stay,"" Shaw told a news conference on Tuesday. ""I've matured. You could say I've gone from a kid to a man. I know what I need to do to push myself. I want to play for Manchester United, stay there and prove my worth to the team."" Shaw was one of the most expensive teenagers in world soccer when he moved to Old Trafford from Southampton for 27 million pounds ($34.70 million) in June 2014 aged 18, having made his England debut four months previously. He was a regular in former United manager Louis van Gaal's team until he broke his leg in two places against PSV Eindhoven in September 2015, missed two months of the 2016-17 season with a groin problem and then twice had operations on his foot. RECOVERY COMPLICATIONS ""I had a lot of complications with my leg and that was the really hard moment for me in my career,"" he added. ""No-one knows but I was really close to actually losing my leg. I never knew that until six months later when the doctor told me. ""At the time, they were thinking about flying me back and if I'd have flown back, I would probably have lost my leg because of the blood clots and stuff."" ""I've got - I don't want to talk about it too much - two scars down the side of my leg where they had to cut it open and pull them out because of how severe it was. ""But I don't really care about that anymore. I feel really strong - and my right leg is exactly as it was before my leg break."" However, his path to recovery was tough to handle mentally. ""I've seen a psychologist. My leg break was a very tough time,"" he said ahead of England's first matches since they reached the World Cup semi-finals without him in the squad. Shaw has seven caps but his last appearance was in March 2017 as a substitute in a 1-0 friendly loss to Germany. He said he was ""gutted"" to miss out on the World Cup and watching from the outside inspired him to have extra training in Dubai during the close season to get fit for the new campaign. ""All the stick I've had in the last few years has pushed me. I wanted to prove everyone wrong and get back to what I do best. I need games to get fully fit and motivated. I'm feeling back to my old self,"" he said ($1 = 0.7781 pounds) (Writing by Ken Ferris; Editing by Toby Davis)",UPDATE 1-Soccer-Mourinho helped me get back in England squad says Shaw, england left back luke shaw believes his manchester united manager jose mourinho was right to criticise him. the 23-year-old was last week named in the england squad for the first time in 18 months for the nations league match against spain on saturday and the friendly with switzerland on t tuesday. his return to the international fold follows a strong start to the season in which he has played every minute of united's opening four games.,"update 1-soccer-mourinho was right to criticise me , says england's shaw"

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-London-October 04: Fitch Ratings has assigned Vodafone Group Plc.'s (VOD) (BBB+/Stable) EUR2 billion, EUR0.5 billion, USD1.3 billion and GBP0.5 billion subordinated hybrid securities a rating of 'BBB-'. The hybrid securities are deeply subordinated and to rank senior only to VOD's ordinary share capital and pari passu with VOD's mandatory convertible bonds due 2019. Coupon payments can be deferred at the discretion of VOD. The 'BBB-' rating is therefore two notches below VOD's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), which reflects the securities' increased loss severity and heightened risk of non-performance relative to senior obligations. This approach is in accordance with Fitch's criteria, ""Non-Financial Corporates Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria"" dated 27 March 2018 at www.fitchratings.com.  The securities qualify for 50% equity credit as they meet Fitch's criteria with regard to subordination, effective maturity of at least five years, full discretion to defer coupons for at least five years and limited events of default, as well as the absence of material covenants and look-back provisions.  VOD has a call option to redeem the notes on any date from the first call date to the first reset date (which will be over five years after the issue date) and at any interest payment date thereafter.  There will be a coupon step-up of 25bp in years 10-12 and an additional step-up of 75bp 20 years after the first reset date. The first call date and the coupon step-up date are not treated as effective maturity dates under Fitch's criteria due to the cumulative amount of the step-ups being lower or equal to 1%. The documentation includes non-binding, intention-based replacement language that supports our permanence assessment of the hybrid instruments.  There is no look-back provision in the securities' documentation, which gives VOD full discretion to unilaterally defer coupon payments. Deferrals of coupon payments are cumulative and compounding and the company will be obliged to make a mandatory settlement of deferred interest payments under certain circumstances, including a payment of ordinary dividend. The hybrids will be used to partly finance VOD's announced acquisition of the Liberty Global cable businesses in Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The structure of the acquisition values the acquired assets at an enterprise value of EUR18.4 billion and includes a cash payment of EUR10.9 billion. The acquisition will take VOD's funds from operations (FFO) net leverage above its downgrade threshold of 3.5x; our initial assessment suggests the metric will exceed this in year one of the transaction but is likely to come down to 3.5x by year three. As such the ratings will have no headroom, and any business underperformance between now and transaction close is likely to lead to a revision of the Outlook to Negative. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strategic Asset Germany: The announced transaction includes Unitymedia, along with cable operations in Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The full consolidation of the cable market in Germany is expected to lead to significant cost synergies and allow VOD to compete far more strongly in fixed and convergent services relative to the incumbent. UM is a strongly performing cable business exhibiting solid revenue and cash growth. The business has no overlap with VOD's previously acquired Kabel Deutschland cable business, which in Fitch's view is the primary motivation for the transaction.   Deleveraging Levers, Financial Policy: Fitch believes VOD retains inorganic levers to deleveraging - including the ability to finesse distribution policy and the potential for non-core asset sales. This flexibility in part helps underpin the Stable Outlook. Fitch typically expects threshold leverage to be achieved within two years of a transaction closing. Some desire from management to pursue these means is also likely to influence the sustainability of a Stable Outlook. VOD has revised its target net debt/EBITDA range to 2.5x-3.0x (previously 2.0x-2.5x). This implies management may seek to manage leverage to a higher threshold.  Historically Fitch-defined FFO net leverage has tended to be around 0.7x higher than VOD's reported net debt/EBITDA metric. If management chooses to keep leverage consistently at the high end of its revised policy range our downgrade threshold is likely to be exceeded indefinitely. Alternative deleveraging levers could help reduce the time to get back within the threshold; an absence of which is likely to increase pressure on the Outlook. DERIVATION SUMMARY VOD's natural peer group includes the large diversified European incumbent telecom operators, Deutsche Telekom AG (DT), Orange S.A. (both BBB+/Stable) and Telefonica SA (BBB/Stable), extending to incumbents with more limited scale, such as BT Group plc (BBB+/Stable), Royal KPN N.V. (BBB/Stable) and Telecom Italia S.p.a (BBB-/Stable). Compared with the large incumbent 'BBB+' rated peers, VOD has a well-diversified portfolio of international businesses, with strong geographic scope, and similar or better growth potential to DT and Orange. Subject to the proposed Liberty Global transaction VOD's leverage is stretched relative to the peer group. The scale and diversification of this peer cohort nonetheless provides deleveraging methods (cash-flow scale, potential for asset sales or minority listings) not enjoyed by smaller operators, providing more latitude in this group's downgrade threshold (set at 3.5x across the peer group). No country ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects impact the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's Key Assumptions within our Rating Case for the Issuer - VOD revenue is expected to grow at low single-digit rates in all financial years to March 2021 with additional revenue of approximately EUR3 billion expected from the Liberty Global assets - EBITDA margins gradually improving to around 32% by 2021 - Capex/sales (excluding spectrum) falling gradually but remaining at 15%-16% per annum - Spectrum payments of EUR2.2 billion in 2020 - Operating cost and capex synergies rising from EUR300 million in the first year of the Liberty Global deal to EUR500 million by year three - EUR1.2 billion of Liberty Global integration costs to be spread over five years, with 75% of the costs being incurred in year one to three. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - FFO adjusted net leverage falling below 2.5x on a sustained basis - Strong free cash flow generation with high single-digit pre-dividend free cash flow on a sustained basis - Continued stability and improving trends across VOD's main operating subsidiaries  Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - FFO adjusted net leverage above 3.5x on a sustained basis, which would lead to a downgrade; - Pressure on free cash flow driven by EBITDA margin erosion, higher capex and shareholder distributions, or significant underperformance in the main operating subsidiaries LIQUIDITY Sound Liquidity: VOD exhibits sound liquidity, including good access to debt markets, strong banking relationships and solid pre-distribution free cash flow. Fitch-defined cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR10.5 billion at end-March 2018 with VOD benefiting from a further EUR7 billion of undrawn bank lines.

"TUNIS, March 17 (Reuters) - Western and Arab countries in a statement on Tuesday urged Libya's warring factions to stop fighting to allow the country's authorities to respond to the threat posed by the coronavirus. Although Libya has yet to record any confirmed cases, the World Health Organisation representative in Tripoli has warned of the great risks faced if the virus spreads in a country fragmented by conflict. For the last year, the eastern-based Libyan National Army under Khalifa Haftar has been waging a military campaign to capture Tripoli, seat of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord. The LNA is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia while the GNA is supported by Turkey. In recent weeks numerous rounds of bombardment have targeted GNA-held areas around Tripoli including around its last functioning airport. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, both the Tripoli and Benghazi administrations have pledged money to local health services and closed ports and airports. A joint statement on Tuesday from Algeria, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United States, the European Union, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates said a truce would help efforts to tackle the virus. ""We strongly support the efforts of Libyan health authorities across the country as they come together in a spirit of national cohesion and urge them to take all necessary measures to support the health and well-being of all Libyans,"" the statement said. ""A truce would also enable combatants to return home to provide care for relatives who may be at higher risk,"" it added.

"By Barbara Grzincic (Reuters) - A former diocese that broke with the Episcopal Church in 2012 over the national organization’s acceptance of gay clergy and same-sex marriage must stop calling itself the “Diocese of South Carolina” and using the trademarked Episcopal shield and diocesan seal, a federal judge in Charleston ruled on Thursday. U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel issued the injunction after ruling for the national church and its reconstituted diocese on claims of trademark infringement, trademark dilution and false advertising under the Lanham Act and state law, rejecting the breakaway group’s claims that it is the true successor to the diocese founded in 1785. “The Defendants have every right to disassociate from (The Episcopal Church) and pursue their doctrine and community as they see fit, yet they may not leave with the Plaintiffs' goodwill and marks generated over the course of over two centuries,” Gergel wrote in the 73-page opinion. The breakaway diocese said in a statement that its leaders and attorneys were “discussing next steps” but that it will be “working in the coming days to come into compliance with this order.” The bishop of the current diocese, known as The Episcopal Church in South Carolina or TECSC, praised Gergel’s ruling but extended an olive branch to the “disassociated diocese.” “While we are thankful, we know that this decision may be difficult for those from the disassociated diocese, and our hope remains that we can all find a path to true reconciliation and restoration of our diocese,” the Rt. Rev. Gladstone Adams III said. The breakaway group includes about 50 individual parishes that voted to end their affiliation with The Episcopal Church of the United States in November 2012, led by Bishop Mark Lawrence. About 30 parishes remained and later became TECSC. Lawrence’s group filed suit in state court in January 2013, seeking to establish ownership of property worth more about $500 million, including historic St. Philip’s Church, which dates back to 1681, and St. Michael’s Church, built the following century, both in Charleston. The state-court judge ruled for the breakaway group in 2015, but the South Carolina Supreme Court reversed that decision in 2017 and found that TECSC was the successor to the historic diocese. The high court remanded the case for additional proceedings, which are ongoing. Meanwhile, Adams’ predecessor as TECSC’s bishop had filed the federal trademark action in March 2013. In its 2017 ruling, the state Supreme Court said the federal court should decide the trademark issues. Both sides then filed motions for summary judgment in the federal court, with TECSC and the U.S. church offering evidence of infringement and a substantial likelihood of confusion. Lawrence and his followers argued, among other things, that “The Episcopal Church” was too generic to be trademarked, or was at best a “weak” mark. Gergel, however, said “The Episcopal Church” was “strong” and well-known, even though “episcopal” and “church” were generic. (In a separate opinion Thursday, the judge ruled that individual parishes whose names include the word “Episcopal” don’t need to change them.) While TECSC’s evidence of strength was not as compelling, even weak marks “are entitled to protection from the use of identical marks in the same geographic region by directly competing goods,” the judge concluded.

" (Adds dealer quote and details on activity; updates prices)     * Canadian dollar at C$1.3043, or 76.67 U.S. cents     * Price of U.S. oil falls 0.2 percent     * Bond prices higher across flatter yield curve      By Fergal Smith     TORONTO, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar edged lower against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday as oil prices fell and the greenback broadly rose, while investors turned attention to Canada's jobs report on Friday.     At 3:15 p.m. EDT (1915 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading 0.2 percent lower at C$1.3043 to the greenback, or 76.67 U.S. cents. The currency traded in a range of C$1.3001 to C$1.3064.     The loonie was buffeted on Wednesday by a diplomatic dispute between Canada and Saudi Arabia, hitting a two-week low at C$1.3121. But it recovered as investors decided that potential Canadian asset sales by Saudi Arabia will have a short-lived impact on the currency.     A dispute over human rights in Saudi Arabia will not have any impact on Saudi oil supplies to Canada, its energy minister said.                  ""The big headlines on Canada and Saudi Arabia are much more noise than anything else,"" said Rahim Madhavji, president of Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange. ""The focus is on the (jobs) data.""     The July employment report could help guide expectations for further Bank of Canada interest rate increases after the central bank hiked rates in July for the fourth time in a year.     Money markets expect the Bank of Canada to raise its benchmark interest rate, which is at 1.50 percent, once more by December.                Canada's dollar will rise over the coming year as the Bank of Canada hikes interest rates and higher oil prices become more supportive of the currency, a Reuters poll showed, but it will take a deal on the North American Free Trade Agreement to trigger bigger gains.                  Mexico's economy minister said the country needed to finish bilateral negotiations with the United States, possibly this week or next, before Canada rejoins talks over a revamped NAFTA.

"By Maja Zuvela SARAJEVO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Bosnian officials bowed to pressure from protesters on Friday and dismissed the management of a residential home after an opposition lawmaker publicised photos showing children with special needs tied to beds and radiators. Hundreds of protests gathered in the capital Sarajevo on Thursday and Friday after Sabina Cudic showed one of Bosnia's two parliaments images of what she said were children in the Pazaric institution near the city, some in straitjackets. The protesters say the situation in the home results from years of corruption and nepotism that have plagued Bosnia since a 1992-5 war left the former Yugoslav republic split into two autonomous parts with layers of ethnically-based government. Police on Friday raided the home, which had been under scrutiny for months over suspected historic financial misconduct, a day after the Sarajevo cantonal prosecutor's office opened a case relating to the alleged abuses. The government of the Bosniak-Croat Federation, which makes up Bosnia along with a Serb republic, said it had ordered the dismissal of the home's general manager and managing and supervisory board and their replacement by professionals. ""As a minister, I am shocked by facts and allegations that have been presented, especially because they relate to the children with mental problems, a vulnerable category that must have special protection,"" Federation Labour and Social Policy Minister Vesko Drljaca told a news conference. The government also ordered health and labour ministries to tackle systemic flaws in the running of the region's care homes. Cudic, of the Nasa Stranka party, had told the Bosniak-Croat parliament 27 out of 149 employees at the home were economists rather than trained carers, and only one person covered night shifts, often without medical training. She described conditions at the home as ""modern-day slavery"", saying she had evidence some workers and patients were forced to work for the previous manager at his private home. That manager has not commented publicly on the allegations. His successor denied any wrongdoing and the minister, Drljaca said: ""All information needs to be thoroughly examined and measures taken to determine the real truth."" The protesters vowed to continue their action next week to press for a better social care network with tighter supervision. ""Professionals rather than party affiliates should deal with our children,"" said Edo Celebic from an association of parents of children with special needs. Bosnia's ombudsmen said the sector badly needed attention. ""It is super-urgent to address the problems of inadequate staffing and accommodation, of supervision of employees and insufficient financial means,"" lead ombudsman Nives Jukic told a news conference in the town of Banja Luka on Friday.

"By Nate Raymond (Reuters) - A federal appeals court has upheld the dismissalof a Utah woman's lawsuit accusing Sanofi SA of failing to warnabout the risks its infertility drug Clomid posed to fetuseswhen taken during pregnancy. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver on Fridayupheld a lower court judge's decision dismissing VictoriaCerveny's state-law failure-to-warn claims against Aventis,which was acquired by Sanofi in 2004. The ruling came in a 2014 lawsuit filed by Cerveny, herhusband and her son, Alexander, who was born with an elbowdeformity and has only three fingers on one hand. The 10th Circuit previously in 2017 partially revived thelawsuit while holding federal law preempted her some of herclaims that Aventis violated Utah law by failing to warn of therisks Clomid posed when taken before pregnancy. In Friday's order, the three-judge panel said that decisionleft Cerveny ""in a tight spot"" once the case was returned toU.S. District Judge Dee Benson in Salt Lake City as her lawyersagreed she took the drug before, not after, becoming pregnant. She argued on remand she would not have taken Clomidpre-pregnancy if she knew taking it afterwards could cause birthdefects. But the 10th Circuit agreed with Benson's decision todismiss that ""unusual"" claim as she never faced the risk oftaking Clomid during her pregnancy.

"* Lewis Group annual earnings up 24% * Luxury furniture unit attracting wealthier clients * Shares jump over 5% JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Reuters) - South Africa's Lewis Groupreported a 24.3% rise in full-year earnings onWednesday as a luxury furniture firm the retailer acquired twoyears ago helped it attract wealthier customers. Shares in the furniture and appliance provider rose morethan 5% as investors cheered the results and a 17% increase inthe group's full-year dividend to 234 cents per share. Lewis Group said headline earnings per share (HEPS) for theyear ended March 31 climbed to 376.2 cents from 302.6 cents ayear earlier. HEPS is the main profit measure in South Africathat strips out certain one-off items. It credited its performance to the acquisition of luxuryhousehold furniture retailer United Furniture Outlets (UFO),which it said had given it access to higher income consumers aswell as its mainstay middle- to low-income customers. Chief Executive Johan Enslin said UFO's new stores weretrading well, and the unit had contributed 478 million rand($33 million) worth of sales in its first full 12 months as partof the group. ""UFO is proving to be a sound acquisition,"" he said in astatement. The retailer said a 22.9% rise in merchandise sales to 3.5billion rand was largely down to the new luxury division, withits wealthier customers boosting cash sales 51.1%. South African consumers, usually reliant on credit forpurchases of all sizes, have been squeezed in recent years byhigh levels of household debt, tax increases and widespreadunemployment. Many retailers have struggled as customers have cut backspending to cope with pressures on their income. Lewis Group, whose shares were up 5.6% at 0809 GMT, alsolaunched INspire last year, a unit that allows consumers to shoponline as well as in store, in a bid to attract online shoppers.After a slower-than-expected start, INspire has generated salesof 27.2 million rand, the firm said. While online purchases make up only 1.4% of total retailsales in South Africa, many retailers are moving into e-commerceto get ahead of a trend that has hit peers overseas. Lewis Group would continue to grow its online offering,though it didn't expect it to be a significant part of thebusiness for some time, Enslin told Reuters by phone. It alsoplanned to open 10 new stores over the next year, he added.

In the worst-hit Gard region, where France's highest-evertemperature was registered on Friday at 45.9 degrees Celsius(114 degrees Fahrenheit), scores of overnight fires burned some550 hectares (about 1,360 acres) of land and destroyed severalhouses and vehicles. ""We came very close to a disaster,"" Didier Lauga, prefect ofthe Gard, told reporters. ""There are still firefighters in placein case fires break out again."" A psychologically unstable man was arrested after starting ablaze in one village, but the extreme heat was likely to blamefor many of the fires, Lauga said. Fifteen firefighters and several police officers wereinjured in the Gard, where 700 firefighters and 10 aircraft weremobilised to contain the flames, emergency services said. In the neighbouring Vaucluse region, authorities said a manwho had been cycling in a mountainous area had died aftercollapsing due to the heat. The sweltering conditions were expected to ease on Saturdayin southern France but highs were still forecast at close to 40degrees. Further north, Paris was due to experience its hottestday of the heatwave with a high of 37-38 degrees predicted. As huge crowds took to the streets of the capital for theannual gay pride parade, firefighters sprayed water onrevellers, some of whom used rainbow-coloured fans and umbrellasto counter the heat. In Germany, organisers of Sunday's Frankfurt Ironman madecontingency plans to keep athletes from overheating intemperatures expected to reach up to 38 degrees. ""EXTREME RISK"" The World Meteorological Organization said this week that2019 was on track to be among the world's hottest years, and2015-2019 would then be the hottest five-year period on record.

"By Karen Freifeld and Alexandra Alper Feb 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. government is considering whether to stop General Electric Co from continuing to supply engines for a new Chinese passenger jet, according to people familiar with the matter, casting uncertainty over China's efforts to enter the civil aviation market. For years, the United States has supported American companies' business with China's budding civil aviation industry. The U.S. government has provided licenses that allow those companies to sell engines, flight control systems and other components for China's first large commercial aircraft, the COMAC C919. The narrow-body jet has already engaged in test flights and is expected to go into service next year. COMAC is an acronym for Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd. But the Trump administration is weighing whether to deny GE's latest license request to provide the CFM LEAP-1C engine for the C919, people familiar with the matter said, though GE has received licenses for the LEAP engines since 2014 and was last granted one in March 2019. The CFM LEAP engine is a joint venture between GE and France's Safran Aircraft Engines. The proposal to halt the deliveries of the engines was also reported on Saturday by the Wall Street Journal. The possible new restrictions on sales of aircraft parts would be the latest move in a deepening battle between the United States and China over technological dominance. The issue is expected to come up at an interagency meeting about how strictly to limit exports of U.S. technology to China on Thursday and another meeting with members of President Donald Trump's Cabinet scheduled for Feb. 28, sources said. The meeting about technology issues also is set to include a discussion of whether to impose further restrictions on suppliers to Huawei Technologies, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, which is on a U.S. trade blacklist. A GE representative declined to comment. However, an industry official said they would like to weigh in on any potential policy shifts. ""If there are any changes, we would hope they would engage with us, as they’ve done before,"" said Remy Nathan, vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group.

"* Issues official response to U.N. inquiry's criticism * Investigation focused on Gaza border protests * U.N. report critical of Israel's use of lethal force By Jeffrey Heller JERUSALEM, March 21 (Reuters) - Israel said on Thursday aU.N. report critical of its use of lethal force duringPalestinian protests on the Gaza border was biased and shouldhave included a demand that the enclave's dominant Hamas grouptake action to stop anti-Israeli violence. A U.N. Commission of Inquiry on the demonstrations, whichbegan nearly a year ago, said this week that Israel shouldinvestigate the shootings of more than 6,000 people, far beyondthe criminal inquiries it has announced into 11 killings. Issuing an official response to the commission's report,Israel said it had ""serious concerns about the factual and legalanalysis conducted by the commission, its methodologies and theclear evidence of political bias against Israel"". Gaza health authorities say some 200 people have been killedand thousands injured by Israeli fire since Palestinianslaunched the protests. One Israeli soldier was shot dead by aPalestinian sniper along the frontier. Protesters have been demanding the lifting of an Israeliblockade of the territory and a right to return to land fromwhich their ancestors fled or were expelled. Israel has said ithas no choice but to use deadly force to defend the frontier. Addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva onMonday, the inquiry commission's chairman, Santiago Canton,called on Israel, which boycotted the day-long debate, to reviewimmediately its military's rules of engagement. Israel's response, published on its Foreign Ministry'swebsite, said the commission's ""bias is most evident in (its)absolute failure ... to make recommendations concerning Hamas"". The militant group, Israel said, sends women, children andothers to sabotage the Israeli security fence along the frontierand to act as shields for armed attacks. Balloons and kites havebeen flown across the border into Israel to start fires. ""If the commission seriously wished to provide an objectivereport that would contribute towards human rights and the safetyof individuals, (it) would have seen fit to demand Hamas takeaction in the context of these events,"" Israel said. Asked about the Israeli allegations, Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamasofficial in Gaza, said ""most of those killed were hit hundredsof metres from the fence - evidence that Israeli soldiers haddeliberately targeted them"". A summary accompanying the 252-page report said protestorganisers ""encouraged or defended demonstrators' indiscriminateuse of incendiary kites and balloons"", and Gaza's de factoauthorities did not stop such acts. The Human Rights Council, a 47-member forum, is due to voteon Friday on four resolutions related to the occupiedPalestinian territories. European states are divided on the resolutions, including atext related to the Gaza inquiry, with some expected to voteagainst and others abstaining, diplomats said.

"(Adds court action in paragraphs 4,5) By Bate Felix PARIS, April 6 (Reuters) - Energy major Total is among several power suppliers that tried to declare force majeure on buying nuclear power from EDF, sources said, as the coronavirus outbreak has pushed prices in the French electricity market far below existing contracts. France's energy market regulator CRE said last week it had rejected requests from several unnamed power suppliers to activate the force majeure clause in so-called ARENH contracts which allow them to buy EDF's nuclear power at a fixed price. Two lobby groups representing French power and gas distributors have launched an urgent procedure with the State Council, the France's highest administrate court, to annul the regulator's decision, a spokesman for the court said on Monday. The lobby groups ANODE and AFIEG represent several energy companies including Total, Eni, Vattenfall, Alpiq, Endesa, and GazelEnergie. A spokeswoman for ANODE declined to comment, while AFIEG could not be reached for comment. The CRE did not say which suppliers declared force majeure, but three sources told Reuters that Total, EDF's biggest rival in France's retail power market, led the move. EDF and Total declined to comment. A spokesman for Engie, the other major player in the French electricity market, said it had not declared force majeure on its ARENH contract. Under the so-called ARENH mechanism set up in 2011 to foster competition, EDF's rivals can buy up to 100 terawatt hours (TWh), or about a quarter of its annual nuclear output, at a fixed price of 42 euros ($46.29) per megawatt hour (MWh). State-controlled EDF operates France's 58 nuclear reactors that account for around 75% of the country's electricity needs. During the annual auction last November, high power prices in the European wholesale market saw strong demand from the ARENH mechanism for delivery in 2020. But the coronavirus outbreak and a general confinement ordered by the government to curb its spread has led to a sharp drop in electricity demand by around 15% to 20%, according to French electricity grid operator RTE. Due to the fall in power consumption, wholesale prices are far from the 42 euros/MWh suppliers paid for the ARENH contract. France's baseload power contract for June delivery is trading 20.40 euros/MWh, while the contract for the third quarter was at 26.20 euros/MWh, by 0920 GMT. THE MARKET HAS TANKED ""The market has completely tanked,"" said one of the sources, adding that the pandemic had led to an exceptional situation which if not dealt with could break the principle of the ARENH contract, which aims to create a level playing field between EDF's commercial arm and rivals. France's energy market regulator CRE said in its statement last week that EDF had rejected the force majeure declaration. The CRE added that regulators considered that force majeure could only apply if a buyer succeeded in demonstrating that its economic situation made it completely impossible to fulfil the ARENH payment obligation, which in its opinion, was not the case in this situation. CRE said it could not suspend the ARENH contracts in their totality because that would benefit suppliers at the expense of EDF. EDF has argued over the years that it wanted the government to scrap the ARENH mechanism because it is advantageous to rivals which buy from it when wholesale power prices are high, but turn to the market when prices are low. The French government has launched a plan to reform the electricity market including the ARENH mechanism.

"By Rupak Chowdhuri and Nivedita Bhattacharjee KOLKATA/BENGALURU, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Indian karate teacher Monimala Halder took up the sport in her teens as a way to get fit. A few months ago, she and her sister used their skills to fend off two men on a motorcycle trying to grab them as they rode past. ""I caught hold of the pillion rider just as he was reaching out for us and we beat them up,"" said Halder, 35, who has seen a steady rise in the number of women seeking self-defence classes in a country where women and children have long been subjected to sexual violence. Police shot dead four men on Friday who were suspected of raping and killing a 27-year-old vet near the southern city of Hyderabad. Some rights groups and politicians criticised the killings, saying they were concerned the judicial process had been sidestepped, but the action was applauded by the victim's family and many citizens outraged by a rising trend of violence against women. India strengthened its laws on sexual violence after the 2012 gang rape and murder of a woman on a Delhi bus led to an outpouring of anger. Reported rapes climbed 31% from 2012 to 2017, government figures show, which officials attribute to greater public awareness rather than an increase in attacks. But a fresh wave of horrific assaults has sparked renewed anger with women across India increasingly turning to everything from karate lessons to pepper spray to take back control. More than 100 showed up at two separate training camps in Kolkata on Sunday to learn self-defence techniques and volunteer groups are setting up similar pop-up camps in other parts of the country. ""I have learnt how to defend myself using daily items like a handbag, or a scarf, and also how we can use our knees to protect ourselves,"" said Anita Roy, 32, who attended one of the Kolkata camps. In the northern town of Faridabad, Akanksha Kathuria, who has twin six-year old daughters, said she plans on setting up self-defence classes after reading about the Hyderabad case and that of a woman in Unnao, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, who died last week after allegedly being set on fire by her rapist and other assailants. ""I shouldn't have to raise daughters with the constant fear of something bad happening to them,"" she said. PEPPER SPRAY Self-defence experts say only a minuscule portion of India's more than 650 million women have access to such classes, and such camps are usually only accessible to those living in cities. Fewer still can commit to such programmes long-term. ""Every time there is a major incident, we see a spike in inquiries,"" said Ritesh Reddy, who teaches self-defence in the tech hub of Bengaluru. ""But the challenge is learning self-defence requires a committed involvement."" It is not just self-defence classes that have seen a surge in popularity. Amazon's Indian arm said pepper spray sales had spiked eight times since the Hyderabad case. The top ten best selling ""safety and security"" items on Amazon's India site last week were pepper sprays, as compared to its portals in the United States, Canada or Singapore, where home monitoring devices and alarm systems were the most popular. ""We've run out of inventory in the past four to five days,"" said Rana Singh, proprietor of Bengaluru-based Aax Global, which makes the popular Cobra branded pepper sprays. Singh said canisters designed to fit in a woman's handbag were the company's most sought-after product. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, where more than 4,200 rape cases - the most in the country - were reported in 2017, victims have formed an organisation, Red Brigade, aimed at empowering women. ""There is barely a school in the city of Lucknow where we've not conducted our camps,"" said founder Usha Vishwakarma. Protests have continued across India since the deaths of the two victims in Hyderabad and Unnao with many people venting online about what they see as an endemic problem. ""This has to stop,"" said Mumbai resident Shraboni Lahiri, the mother of a four-year old girl said. ""It's not possible, or healthy, to monitor your child every moment of the day.""

"(Repeats column originally published Aug 23. The opinionsexpressed here are those of the author, a market analyst forReuters.) By Karen Braun ROCHESTER, Minn., Aug 23 (Reuters) - After four days ofsampling corn and soybean fields across the U.S. Corn Belt, Ihave more concern for soybean yields rather than those for corn.Pod counts on the soybean plants were down significantly fromlast year, especially in the Eastern Belt. Further, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's state yieldforecasts are down much less on the year than those pod countsin certain states. This week’s field samples might suggest somedownside to USDA’s soybean yield forecast of 48.5 bushels peracre. On the other hand, USDA’s corn yield peg of 169.5 bushelsper acre might be closer to reality, depending on how the cropfinishes. The individual state outlooks were corroborated byscouts after the four-day tour, except for in South Dakota. I was a scout on the Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour throughthe main corn and soybean producing areas of the United States.I was on the western leg of the tour, through South Dakota,Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota. The eastern leg went throughOhio, Indiana, Illinois, and eastern and central Iowa. The Crop Tour is a long-running annual event held in thethird week of August every year and it is hosted in partnershipwith Farm Journal, the parent company of Pro Farmer. This year,scouts took yield measurements in 1,473 corn fields and 1,461soybean fields across the seven states. Crop Tour participants were eager to see what the fieldswould look like after the record-late planting season for cornand soybeans. Many market participants could not believe thenational yields could be as high as USDA predicted based on howmuch of the crops were planted in June. Corn across the Midwest was expectedly much less mature thana year ago, when the crop was far ahead of normal after a warmstart to the season. The majority of the fields randomly sampledon the Crop Tour were pollinated and therefore eligible to bemeasured. Maturity was only an issue in parts of South Dakotaand the Eastern Corn Belt. It is important to remember that the Crop Tour yield numbersare best compared against those from previous tours, becausethere are sampling biases in certain states based on the partsof the state that the routes cover. Pro Farmer will be taking the Crop Tour data and otherinformation into account when it publishes national andstate-level estimates for corn and soybean yields on Friday at1:30 pm CDT. CORN AS EXPECTED USDA’s largest corn yield departures from a year ago are inIllinois and Ohio, both down 14% on the year, and in Indiana,down 12%. The Crop Tour samples were down exactly 14% from lastyear’s tour in Ohio, and they were down only 11% in Illinois andIndiana. All three of these states reached new record cornyields in 2018. Tour yields were down 3% on the year in Iowa and down 5% inMinnesota, and those are the exact deviations the current USDAcorn estimates imply. The Tour suggests Nebraska yield down 4%on the year while USDA’s number is down 3%. South Dakota is where the big deviation occurred. Crop Tourscouts found corn yields to be down 13% from last year’s tour,but USDA has yield down only 2% from a year ago. The Tour yieldcalculations assume a relatively normal finish to the crop, butbeing so far north, the latest-planted South Dakota corn is at agreater risk of a killing frost than equally late corn in theEastern Belt. I thought that the corn on my routes looked good. It waseasy to see that generally mild weather since planting hasreally been favorable for the crop potential. Other than theapproaching frost and freeze risks for some of the immaturecorn, I would not expect a large downside to the 169.5 bushelsper acre, at least based on what I saw and heard on the Tour. SOYBEANS NOT SO HOT Soybeans have had me a little more concerned since June asmore than half of the crop was planted that month. Soybeansdepend on sunlight and day length for optimal growth potential,so I expected to see fewer pods on the plants than I did inprevious years. I was correct in this thinking, but the podcounts were lower than I thought they would be. The average number of pods found in a three-by-three-footsquare were notably down from a year ago in all seven states,but these deviations were much larger than USDA’s yielddepartures from last year. From last year’s Tour, pod counts were down 39% in Ohio,down 30% in Indiana, and down 25% in Illinois. USDA’s yieldforecasts for those states are down 17%, 15%, and 15%,respectively, from 2018. The differences were not as big in theWestern Belt except for in South Dakota, where tour data wasdown 19% but USDA is down only 2%. I was personally counting soybean pods all week, and otherthan the pod counts being down, I thought the crop had somepotential. Soybeans on my routes were not as poor as theaverages suggest, but I did notice that two- and three-bean podswere more common than the threes and fours that you see in agreat year. I also did not see a lot of top clusters packed withbeans, which also boosts yields. I did not see much disease,either. A lot of the pods were still relatively flat versus a yearago, meaning the beans still need some time to fill out.Sunshine and intermittent rains would help that process. Theother caveat to soybeans is that more of the plants were stillblooming than the Crop Tour usually observes, and this meansthat there is a potential to still add pods in some cases. How much might soybean yield fall from the USDA estimate of48.5 bushels per acre? Soybeans are always tricky to gauge sincethere are still so many moving parts, so that question is veryhard to answer. Will more pods form? How large will they be? Howlarge will the beans become inside the current pods? It seems very unlikely that enough pods could still be addedto make up for the large deficits in the Eastern Belt, and thenumber of pods in the West are mostly set, meaning the numberswill undoubtedly remain lower, and this will keep a cap onfurther yield potential this year.",RPT-COLUMN-More concern for soy yields than corn after U.S. Crop Tour -Braun,"i was a scout on the pro farmer midwest crop tour throughthe main corn and soybean producing areas of the united states. pod counts on the soybean plants were down significantly fromlast year , especially in the eastern belt. this week’s field samples might suggest somedownside to usda’s soybean yield forecast of 48.5 bushels peracre. on the other hand , usda’s corn yield peg of 169.5 bushelsper acre might be closer to reality.","rpt-column-soybean pod counts , usda yield forecasts diverge sharply from tour data - braun"
"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2020 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote http://tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv By Olga Cotaga LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Sterling rose on Friday as investors became more confident that the United States government and central bank economic stimulus could alleviate some of the impact of the coronavirus crisis. The U.S. dollar had previously strengthened on the back of its perceived safe-haven status while sterling - considered a riskier currency more closely associated with equity market performance - moved in the opposite direction. Waters have calmed since the U.S. government promised $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus and the Federal Reserve injected more dollars into the financial market by buying U.S. government bonds and swaping dollars for foreign currencies with other major central banks. ""We are now seeing the predictable reversal of G10 FX performance on the back of the broad depreciation of the dollar in response to the liquidity measures by the Federal Reserve and the government measures on top,"" said Derek Halpenny, head of research at MUFG. ""Assuming these more favourable financial market conditions can now last for a period ... sterling could be rewarded further by the economic policies of the government to target more specifically the protection of employment."" The British government on Thursday said it will pay grants to self-employed people who have lost their livelihoods because of the coronavirus lockdown, further extending an unprecedented package of measures to bolster the economy. Finance minister Rishi Sunak had previously announced that the state would pay part of employee wages to dissuade companies from implementing layoffs. Sterling was up 0.4% at $1.2253, having touched a near-two-week high of $1.2304. It gained more against the euro, rising by 0.8% to 89.80 pence. Halpenny said that sterling will continue to be affected by how fast COVID-19 spreads in the UK, where the number of coronavirus cases and deaths on Thursday registered their biggest daily increase since the epidemic reached Britain. The cost of financial derivatives aimed at protecting traders against unexpected swings in the currency have eased but remained at relatively elevated levels, suggesting money managers are still nervous. BMO analyst Stephen Gallo suspects that leveraged funds cut their long positions on the British currency in the week through March 24 as dollar/sterling fell through $1.15.

"By Hugh Bronstein BUENOS AIRES, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Argentina can avoidrestructuring its bonds if policymakers reverse growth-stiflingausterity measures in time to spur enough economic growth toavoid a debt crisis, Nobel Prize-winning economist JosephStiglitz said on Monday. A crushing defeat for business-friendly President MauricioMacri in the Aug. 11 primary election at the hands of hisPeronist rival Alberto Fernandez unnerved investors, who worriedthat the return of the left to power could herald a debtrestructuring in Latin America's third-largest economy. The peso currency lost nearly a quarter of its value lastweek and the price of Argentine bonds tumbled, pushing upborrowing costs. Based on Friday's closing prices, the cost ofinsuring Argentine debt implied a 77% probability of a sovereigndefault within the next five years, according to IHS Markit. However, Stiglitz, former chief economist of the World Bankand a critic of austerity measures during the euro zone debtcrisis, said Macri's tight fiscal policies had brought theeconomy to a standstill just when growth was needed to ensureArgentina can service its debts. ""The problem is that the policies the government had engagedin were not conducive to economic growth,"" Stiglitz told Reutersby telephone. ""Austerity and the tight budgets lead to lowgrowth and that makes the debt less sustainable."" Argentina's economy is expected to shrink 1.5% this year,according to the latest central bank poll of analysts. Growthfor 2020 was seen at 2.0%. A new treasury minister, Hernan Lacunza, takes over onTuesday with the daunting challenge of trying to turn theeconomy around in time for the Oct. 27 presidential election. Fernandez, now the front-runner for the election, warned inan interview on Sunday that a debt restructuring may benecessary. He said he would seek to renegotiate a $57 billionprogram with the International Monetary Fund. Fernandez says he disagrees with Macri's austerity measures,which, while directed at cutting the fiscal deficit, havehobbled growth while battering the president's popularity. ""I think Fernandez is unambiguously likely to have a betterpolicy,"" said Stiglitz. ""Whether it's enough to avoid the needfor a debt restructuring depends on how deep the hole is thatMacri dug over the last three-and-a-half years."" Fresh from the thumping he got in the primary vote, Macrilast week loosened the tough fiscal policies he had enactedunder the IMF program signed last year. In a stark policy turnaround, he cut food taxes andincreased welfare spending, among other measures. The IMF's next review of Argentina's economy on Sept. 15should provide a sign of whether the lender of last resort stillthinks Argentina can pay its obligations. Another crunch pointwill be the second quarter of 2020, when Argentina is scheduledto make $20 billion in debt repayments, up sharply from $5.6billion in the first quarter. Macri took office in late 2015 promising to reintegrateArgentina with the global bond market after years of beinglocked out due to the previous administration's multi-year feudwith holders who rejected the terms offered in the country'sprevious debt restructurings. Former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, afree-spending populist and Macri's most prominent politicalenemy, is running as Alberto Fernandez's vice presidentialcandidate. Argentina under Kirchner was an international capitalmarkets pariah. Rather than issuing bonds, she used central bankreserves to fund the government while heavily taxing the farmsector and running up high fiscal deficits. From the very low level of foreign indebtedness left by theKirchner administration, Argentina under Macri issued too muchdebt too fast, Stiglitz said. ""He began with an almost clean slate and he borrowed toomuch. He bet big and he bet wrong,"" Stiglitz said.

"By Patricia Zengerle and Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump declared ""a star is born"" after Republican Representative Elise Stefanik strongly defended him during last week's impeachment hearings in Congress. But someone else also got a boost from Stefanik's new fame: her Democratic election opponent. Tedra Cobb, a former county legislator who is hoping to win Stefanik's House of Representatives seat next year, announced on Twitter Sunday evening that she raised $1 million in just two days after Stefanik's high-profile performance in the impeachment hearings. Stefanik, 35, a three-term congresswoman, was one of the sharpest questioners of witness Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and other diplomats who testified last week. Stefanik also tangled repeatedly with the committee's Democratic chairman, Representative Adam Schiff. The hearings raised Stefanik's national profile. ""A new Republican Star is born. Great going @EliseStefanik!"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday. But the proceedings also incensed Stefanik's opponents, who took to social media to fundraise for Cobb and increase her profile. Cobb's campaign account had 6,200 followers on Twitter on Friday morning. By Monday she had 248,500, and she launched repeated fundraising appeals over the weekend. Stefanik's campaign did not disclose how much money it had raised over the weekend, and a campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The campaign posted a series of Tweets criticizing Schiff, blasting ""radical liberals & never-Trumpers"" and denouncing ""disgusting attacks against me in an attempt to silence me"". Stefanik defeated Cobb by 14 points to retain her House seat last year, but it was her closest race since she was first elected to Congress in 2014 at the age of 30. At the time she was the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, and she remains the youngest of just 13 Republican women in the House. Her upstate New York district backed Democrat Barack Obama for president in 2008 and 2012 before voting for Trump in 2016. Until emerging last week as a vociferous defender of Trump, Stefanik had been known as a moderate. She called Trump's decision to withdraw from the international Paris agreement on climate change a ""mistake"" and criticized his 2017 travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries.

"By Anthony Esposito MEXICO CITY, Dec 11 (Reuters) - After the initial euphoria had subsided, Mexican business leaders emerged bruised and resigned to a new stricter trade deal with the United States and Canada that could usher in more intrusive enforcement of labor rules in Mexico. Moises Kalach, a leader of the CCE business lobby, which represented Mexico's private sector in the negotiation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that will replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), said that businesses felt sidelined. ""We would have liked to have been (in the negotiations) more ... to give our opinion more. This is the reality, we participated but not as much as we would have liked,"" said Kalach. USMCA was signed more than a year ago to replace NAFTA, but Democrats controlling the U.S. House of Representatives insisted on major changes to labor and environmental enforcement before bringing it to a vote. In an unusual display of bipartisan and cross-border cooperation in the Trump era of global trade conflicts, top officials from Canada, Mexico and the United States on Tuesday signed a fresh overhaul of the quarter-century-old trade pact. Some Mexican business groups bemoaned a lack of clarity and conflicting information on how the rules would actually be enforced under the deal, the text of which has not been made public. Gustavo Hoyos, president of employers federation Coparmex and a vocal critic of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said ""up to now virtually no one but government officials have seen the deal's fine print"". He called the government ""a bad negotiator."" Others were more positive. ""There were many things we would have liked to have seen but in general we can say this deal is very beneficial for Mexico, it will bring investment to the country and I have no doubt will make the North American region more competitive,"" said Antonio del Valle, head of the Mexican Business Council. ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM The deal included a new mechanism under which the United States and Canada can create panels of labor experts to investigate union complaints at Mexican factories. The experts will be able to penalize goods and services exported from that plant if violations of the freedom to organize or collectively bargain are detected, Canada and the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee said. Mexico's chief negotiator Jesus Seade sought to play down the impact of such ""rapid panels,"" saying he had fended off U.S. union demands to place foreign labor inspectors in Mexican factories. The rapid panels would be formed after three months and only in response to repeated complaints and they would be selected from a roster of experts, including one from each country involved in the dispute and one chosen by a third party, Seade said. The Mexican official denied there would be anything like foreign labor inspectors in Mexico. Canada said that, under the new deal, the burden of proof has been reversed, in that failure to comply with an obligation in the chapter is now presumed to be ""in a manner affecting trade or investment between the parties,"" unless the defending party can demonstrate otherwise. ""If I'm reading this correctly now the country defending itself is guilty until proven otherwise,"" said a former senior Mexican USMCA negotiator. ""This can become an incentive to block trade ... you just gave the U.S. an instrument to impose tariffs and close markets, because it is going to be accusing you of not complying with your labor standards."" Duncan Wood, director of the Wilson Center's Mexico Institute in Washington, said ""that while the word 'inspections' has been avoided, 'facility-based enforcement' and in-country 'labor attaches' will raise the specter of foreign interference for some in Mexico.""

"By Aaron Sheldrick TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Japan's trade ministry on Monday spelt out ways that buyers and sellers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) can rework supply contracts to remove restrictions on resale of cargoes which Japan last year said were anti-competitive. Japan's anti-monopoly watchdog ruled in June last year that all new LNG contracts should not restrict resale of the fuel, marking a step towards liberalising the LNG market in Asia. But global LNG suppliers have been slow to revise their contracts for Japanese buyers. The trade ministry presented the so-called ""model diversion clause"" for supply contracts at an annual conference in Nagoya. The suggested language follows the lack of action on renegotiating contracts following the last year' ruling. Buyers in Japan, the world's biggest LNG importer, have long complained about the so-called destination clauses restricting resale. They want more leeway to resell spare cargoes but have been prevented by the clauses. The Japan Fair Trade Commission's ruling last year found that the destination clauses, long-time features of LNG sales contracts that restrict buyers from selling cargoes to third parties, were anti-competitive. At the time it was thought that ruling would force the renegotiation of billions of dollars of existing LNG contracts. ""No-one has struck out a destination clause on the basis of the ruling, as far as I'm aware,"" one lawyer who has spent decades involved in LNG contract negotiations told Reuters at the conference. In new contracts, the clauses are rarely included, the LNG lawyer said. The trade ministry's ""model diversion clause"" for LNG sale and purchases contracts spells out contractual arrangements for cargo diversions, including delivery specifications and profit sharing or compensation arrangements.

"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, acolumnist for Reuters.) By Mark Miller CHICAGO (Reuters) - Is it time to raise the Social Securityretirement age? The idea crops up often as a partial fix for thelong-term financial challenges facing the program. A higher retirement age would reduce the number of years onaverage that people receive benefits, as a way to cut programcosts. But according to an economist at the Urban Institute whospecializes in employment and retirement decisions made by olderAmericans, raising the retirement age would inflict serious harmon roughly one-quarter of Social Security beneficiaries. In a report issued by the Urban Institute last month,Richard W. Johnson examines the arguments in favor and against ahigher retirement age, considering trends and disparities inAmerican workers' life expectancy, health status and the labormarket conditions that older workers face. (https://urbn.is/2qPHqyA) When Social Security was created in 1935, benefits began atage 65. Starting in 1956 for women, and in 1961 for men,retirees could claim benefits as soon as age 62, but monthlybenefits were reduced permanently depending on how early theyfiled. Meanwhile, the age when 100 percent of earned benefitsare paid - the full retirement age (FRA) - began to risegradually under reforms legislated in 1983. The FRA is graduallyincreasing to age 67 for workers born in 1960 or later; forexample, workers born between 1943 and 1954 reach their FRA atage 66; for people born in 1955 the FRA will be 66 and twomonths. Social Security faces a long-run financial imbalance - theprogram is now spending more than it takes in annually inpayroll taxes. The Social Security trustees project that theprogram will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2034;unless Congress takes action, benefits would be slashedacross-the-board by about 25 percent. Congress has three options for avoiding this dire outcome.It could raise revenue by increasing the payroll tax andincreasing the share of wages subject to the tax. A secondoption is to cut benefits by reducing cost-of-living adjustmentsor through other benefit formula changes. The third option israising retirement ages - effectively reducing the number ofyears, on average, when benefits are received. That could closeroughly 27 percent of the long-term shortfall, Johnsoncalculates. A LONGEVITY ARGUMENT Rising longevity is one argument often made in favor of thatlast reform. Americans live several years longer, on average,than they did when the early retirement age was introduced, andlongevity is forecast to rise 2.8 years by 2050, Johnsonreports. ""The program's costs will rise as people live longer,""he told me in an interview. ""Is there a certain number of yearsof life we want to finance in retirement that we maintain byshifting that period later?"" The retirement age debate usually focuses on the FRA, butJohnson focuses mainly on whether the early retirement ageshould be increased. ""If we want to raise the FRA, we also wouldwant to raise the early age,"" he said. ""If the gap between thetwo gets too large, it would create inequities."" Here is what that means. Johnson calculates that filing at62 currently translates into a 30 percent monthly benefit cutcompared with filing at the FRA; if the FRA were increased to 69without lifting the early age, that early-filing reduction wouldjump to a whopping 40 percent. ""That might be a wash in lifetimebenefits, depending on how long you live,"" he said. ""But thelarger point for most retirees is, you pay your bills on amonthly basis."" But increasing the early filing age would create hardshipsfor many workers. If it were raised to age 65, Johnson estimatesthat 25 percent of workers aged 62 to 64 would face seriousfinancial problems; that represents the share that is notworking and has a health-related work limitation. These workers are more likely to have health problems intheir early sixties that limit their work ability, Johnsonconcludes, and many will not be able to pass the strict medicaland functional screens of Social Security Disability Insurance.He also cites ongoing reluctance among employers to hire olderworkers, and the fact that the recent gains in life expectancyhave gone mainly to people with more education and income. ""We were seeing improvements in health status until 2000,but those have leveled off and we don't know what will happen inthe future,"" Johnson said. ""The most concerning part is we'renow seeing some indications that health status is declining forpeople in their sixties now, and for people in their forties andfifties, mainly due to rising obesity rates. All of that willmake it much more difficult to raise retirement ages."" Rising income inequality also contributes to the problem, hefinds. Lower-income workers are more likely to retire early -and that means they will have lower incomes throughoutretirement. Conversely, median income for older householdswithout any health-related work limits rose 34 percent from 1996to 2014, adjusted for household size and inflation. This was dueto their greater likelihood of staying employed and receivingwage income. What kind of policy changes could be made to buffer the mostvulnerable people from higher retirement ages? Johnson suggestsexempting workers in physically demanding occupations; makingthe Social Security benefit formula more progressive than italready is to favor low-earners even more; expanding employmentservices and training and expanding unemployment insurance forolder workers. But he concedes all of these would be challenging policiesto achieve from a political standpoint. ""Most programs fordesperate people don't get a lot of funding, so the prospectsare not great,"" he said. ""There is a real risk that we couldraise the early Social Security filing age and not offer enoughprotections to the people most at risk.""",COLUMN-A higher Social Security retirement age comes with risks for many workers,is it time to raise the social securityretirement age ? the idea crops up often as a partial fix for the long-term financial challenges facing the program. a higher retirement age would reduce the number of years onaverage that people receive benefits.,"column-raising social security retirement age would hurt many workers , not just the rich"

"* Yuan's fall sparks worries about China's economy, * Steel makers, metal cos, shippers among biggest losers * Semi-conductor shares down after soft TSMC earnings * Defensive shares continue to attract funds By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, July 20 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks ended weaker on Friday as an earlier decline in the Chinese yuan rekindled worries about the stability of the world's second largest economy, which faces rising risks from a major trade conflict with the United States. Japan's Nikkei share average fell 0.29 percent to 22,697.88 while the broader Topix shed 0.26 percent to 1,744.98. However, both indexes posted their second straight weeks of gains. The losses were driven by selling in Nikkie futures after the yuan weakened below 6.8 per dollar in the onshore trade for the first time in a year. However, a bounce in the yuan later on suspected support from Chinese state banks helped the Nikkei pare some of its losses. ""Further falls in the yuan will heighten worries about capital flights like the one we saw in 2015-16. So there is knee-jerk selling,"" said Hideyuki Ishiguro, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. Steel makers, non-ferrous metal companies and shippers - the regular victims of trade war worries - led the losses with falls of 1.3 percent, 1.7 percent and 1.4 percent respectively. Kobe Steel dropped 2.3 percent after the company was indicted by prosecutors over a data tampering scandal that shook the company last year. Insurers fell 1.1 percent as their earnings are seen squeezed by continuous flattening in the yield curve. Semi-conductor related shares came under pressure after Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, trimmed its annual revenue and capital spending estimates on bleak demand from smartphone and cryptocurrency mining industries. Tokyo Electron fell 3.0 percent and Sumco shed 4.1 percent. Advertising firm Dentsu sank 7.5 percent in heavy trade, with market players citing unexpectedly weak sales from its French rival Publicis. On the other hand, some defensive shares continued to attract funds from investors trying to minimise exposure to the risk of global trade wars.

"(Adds comments from analysts) By Rocky Swift and Junko Fujita TOKYO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - SoftBank has ample funds to endure the pain from its massive bailout of WeWork, analysts said, even as it is reportedly set to write down at least $5 billion due to a slump in the value of the U.S. office sharing startup and some other top holdings. SoftBank Group Corp agreed to offer a $9.5 billion lifeline to WeWork this week to take control of the U.S. office-space sharing startup, now valued at $8 billion. The deal, which comes on top of more than $10 billion investment SoftBank has already committed, is set to strain the Japanese investment firm's bottom line. Citing people with knowledge of the matter, Bloomberg said SoftBank would announce the writedown along with its second-quarter earnings on Nov. 6. A SoftBank spokesman declined to comment on the report. The company's shares fell 1.2% in Tokyo. Since spinning off its namesake telecom unit SoftBank Corp , analysts now view SoftBank as a financial holding company. More akin to a bank, the company is taking on more debt and relying on cash flows from its operating units to pay the interest. ""From a leverage standpoint, SoftBank has some cushion to take on additional debt,"" said Moody's analyst Motoki Yanase. Although SoftBank has an army of retail investors in yield-strapped Japan willing to buy its junk bonds, it already holds about 5 trillion yen of net debt on its balance sheet - more than half its 9 trillion yen market capitalisation. Both Moody's and S&P Global rate SoftBank below investment grade. That means the company has to pay higher interest on its bonds and loans. The company's weighted average cost of debt is 3.7%, the seventh-highest among all companies on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, according to Refinitiv data. Even so, SoftBank retains huge holdings in listed companies that could be sold off if the company needs cash, said S&P analyst Hiroyuki Nishikawa. Portfolio companies backed by SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund include British chip designer ARM, Slack Technologies Inc, and ride-hailing firms such as Uber Technologies Inc, Grab and Didi. Jefferies downgraded SoftBank stock to hold from buy on Friday, saying that WeWork rescue sets an ""undesirable precedent"" for the group's private investments. ""We don't know where the risk limit is for SoftBank given they have bet so heavily,"" said Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal. Among more typical private equity funds ""most of them probably let go of the failures, they don’t double down"".

"By Will Boggs MD NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Oral antibiotic use appears toincrease the risk of colon cancer and reduce the risk of rectalcancer, according to a database study. ""Our findings highlight that careful and appropriate use ofantibiotics is very important, not only for avoidance ofinducing antimicrobial, which is a major problem in treatingpatients currently, but also because of the potential impact onlonger-term health and the development of chronic diseases,"" Dr.Cynthia L. Sears from Johns Hopkins University School ofMedicine, in Baltimore, Maryland, told Reuters Health by email. Previous epidemiological studies have suggested anassociation between antibiotic use and an increased risk ofprostate, breast, lung and colon cancers, but findings have beeninconsistent. Dr. Sears and colleagues used data from the ClinicalPractice Research Datalink in the U.K., the world's largestprimary-care database, to investigate the associations betweenantibiotic use and site-specific colorectal-cancer risk. Individuals who developed colon cancers were slightly, butsignificantly, more likely to be exposed to antibiotics (71.3%vs. 69.1%), whereas those with and without rectal cancers hadcomparable exposure to antibiotics (67.1% vs. 67.2%). In the colon, the excess risk of cancer wasduration-dependent and was more marked in the proximal colon. Inthe rectum, antibiotic use exceeding 60 days was associated witha 15% reduction in the odds of developing cancer, compared withno use (P=0.003). Use of antibiotics with anti-anaerobic action wereassociated with an increased colon-cancer risk, while an inverseassociation with antibiotic exposure was seen for rectal cancer,regardless of effects on anaerobes, the researchers report inGut, online August 19. Among specific antibiotic classes, penicillins wereassociated with a 9% increase in the risk of colon cancer,whereas tetracyclines were associated with a 10% reduction inthe risk of rectal cancer by 10%. For colon cancers, the increased risk emerged after minimalantibiotic use and reached a plateau after 60 days of cumulativeexposure. In contrast, the reduced risk of rectal cancerassociated with antibiotic exposure was not seen until after 30days of cumulative exposure and reached a plateau after 90 days. Among participants with at least 15 years of follow-up,antibiotic use more than 10 years before the cancer diagnosiswas associated with an increased colon-cancer risk, whereasearlier antibiotic use was not associated with colon-cancerrisk. In contrast, the time window of antibiotic use was notsignificantly associated with the reduced rectal cancer risk. ""We hope that this reinforces to physicians and patients/thepublic that when antibiotics are needed they can be life-saving,but inappropriate use of antibiotics, such as for viral upperrespiratory tract infections, is to be avoided,"" Dr. Sears said.""Similarly, we should all seek to take antibiotics targeted toany particular infection for the shortest time possible that isdefined as effective for the infection."" She added, ""This work was eye-opening to us, and while thiswork does not define causality, it broadens and emphasizes ourunderstanding of the importance of antibiotic stewardship andgood practices in use of antibiotics."" Dr. Yu-Xiao Yang from Perelman School of Medicine at theUniversity of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, who has alsoresearched the impact of antibiotic exposure on the risk ofcolorectal cancer, told Reuters Health by email, ""The clinicalimplication is that antibiotic-induced alterations in gutmicrobiome might play an important role in the pathogenesis ofcolorectal cancer, perhaps more so for proximal colon cancer.There may be one more reason now to exercise judiciousprescribing of antibiotics."" ""These results are hypothesis generating,"" said Dr. Yang,who was not involved in the study. ""More research is needed."" Dr. Andrew T. Chan from Massachusetts General Hospital andHarvard Medical School, in Boston, who also was not involved inthe new work, recently found an increased risk of colorectaladenoma with long-term antibiotic use in early-to-middleadulthood. He told Reuters Health by email, ""These studieshighlight the important role that the bacteria that reside inour intestines may play in the development of colorectal cancer.Frequent use of antibiotics may alter the naturally occurringcomposition of the bacteria in our bodies which could lead tohealth consequences, including predisposing the colon to thedevelopment of cancer."" ""These data support the importance of physicians beingjudicious about their use of antibiotics,"" he said. ""Antibioticsare often too easily prescribed because they are usually welltolerated in the short-term with few side effects. However,emerging data suggest that the frequent use of antibiotics mightalter our bodies' natural balance of bacteria, leading tolong-term health effects."" ""These data support the need for further research into howour complex intestinal microbial communities influence thedevelopment of cancer and how they can be potentiallymanipulated to actually prevent cancer,"" Dr. Chan said.

"By Sijia Jiang HONG KONG, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Huawei Technologiessaid it was seeking compensation from its contract manufacturerFlex Ltd for illegally withholding some 400 millionyuan ($57 million) worth of its goods in the wake of a U.S.trade ban on the Chinese firm. Huawei spokesman Guo Fulin did not comment on the amount,but a person with direct knowledge of the matter said thecompany had sent a lawyer's letter to Flex on Monday demanding""hundreds of millions of yuan"" in damages for lost income,wasted materials, equipment replacements and other costs. In the letter, Huawei says Flex's Chinese unit ""disregardedChinese law"" by refusing to return production equipment, rawmaterials and half-made products belonging to Huawei wortharound 400 million yuan at its Zhuhai factory ""for nearly twomonths"" after Washington banned Huawei in May, the source said. Headquartered in California, Flex is among the world'slargest electronic manufacturers and competes against Taiwan'sFoxconn Technology in providing contract services forHuawei products such as smartphones and 5G base stations. The Huawei-Flex situation marks the latest fallout fromWashington's trade sanctions against Huawei that has caused muchdisruption and confusion in the global tech supplychain. The ban forbids U.S. firms, or non-U.S. firms with more than25% American components in their products, from doing businesswith Huawei. Washington subsequently gave a three-month reprieveuntil Aug. 19 and suggested it could relax the limit by allowingsome suppliers to apply for export licenses. A Flex spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday that the companywas preparing a statement and could not immediately comment. Flex has previously said it was ""actively working"" withHuawei ""to find a mutually agreeable way forward"" after theirpartnership had ""recently been impacted by unforeseen challengesresulting from the US/China trade situation"". Huawei had in July estimated the worth of the goods seizedby Flex at some 700 million yuan. Of this, according to asource, 400 million yuan worth of goods were being held in Chinaand the rest outside. It is unclear how much Huawei goods is still with Flex, butHuawei sources say the firm has retrieved most of the goods viathird parties, adding to its costs. Flex said on Monday the ""market situation and customer need""was impacting some of its jobs in China, where it employs morethan 50,000 workers. According to local media reports, the firmcould be cutting 10,000 jobs in the country as a result oflosing Huawei as a customer. Huawei spokesman Guo declined to say whether the Chinesetelecommunications giant had cut ties with Flex. Like Flex, U.S. courier FedEx too has been caught upin a row stemming from the ban on Huawei after it was found tohave withheld or diverted Huawei packages, leading to a Chinesegovernment investigation.

"HONG KONG, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters have set themselves a busy schedule for Saturday, rebuilding ""Lennon Walls"" of anti-government graffiti and marking the fifth anniversary of the ""Umbrella"" street movement that gridlocked the city for weeks. Thousands of protesters rallied at the harbourside on Friday, chanting slogans accusing the police of brutality amid more than three months of often violent unrest in the Chinese-ruled territory. That came ahead of the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China on Tuesday, when there are pro- and anti-Beijing protests planned across the former British colony, including at the British Consulate where protesters this month asked for help in reining in Beijing. Protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland. China vehemently denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of inciting the unrest. Saturday is also the fifth anniversary of the start of the ""Umbrella"" protests, 79 days of student-led demonstrations in 2014 calling for universal suffrage that failed to wrest concessions from Beijing. One of the most prominent leaders of those protests, the bespectacled Joshua Wong, 22, is expected to announce on Saturday he will run for local district council elections in November, his supporters said. He is on bail after being charged with inciting and participating in an unauthorised assembly outside police headquarters on June 21. Thousands of people are also expected to rally in the city centre on Saturday evening. Protests are expected on Sunday to mark Global Anti-Totalitarianism Day, with solidarity events planned in cities across the world, including Paris, Berlin, Taipei, New York, Kiev and London. But the biggest protests are likely to be on Oct. 1, marking the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, with protesters saying they plan to use the holiday to propel calls for greater democracy. Activists plan a mass rally from Victoria Park in the bustling Causeway Bay district to Chater Garden, a cricket pitch back in colonial days, home to the elite Hong Kong Cricket Club, in downtown Central. Official festivities for National Day have been scaled back, with authorities keen to avoid embarrassing Beijing at a time when President Xi Jinping is seeking to project an image of national strength and unity. The protests were sparked in June by a bill, since withdrawn, that would have allowed extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement. The Lennon Walls are large mosaics of Post-it notes calling for democracy which have cropped up in underpasses, under footbridges, outside shopping centres, at bus stops and universities and elsewhere across the territory. Some Lennon Walls of graffiti were torn down by pro-Beijing activists last weekend.

Consumer prices in Sweden measured with a fixed interest rate (CPIF) fell 1.5% in January from the previous month and were up 1.2% from the same month last year, the statistics office (SCB) said. Stripping out volatile energy prices, inflation was 1.6% in January versus the same period last year. The Riksbank said at its last meeting in February that it expected falling energy prices to affect inflation in the short term, but stuck with its forecast for unchanged rates over the coming years, saying stripped of volatile elements, inflation was broadly stable. However, January inflation numbers were well below the central bank's most recent forecasts for headline inflation of 1.54% and, excluding energy prices, of 1.90%. Analysts in a Reuters poll forecast 1.6% and 1.9% respectively. The central bank targets 2 percent CPIF inflation. The Swedish currency eased against the euro after the inflation data. The Riksbank hiked in December, ending nearly 5 years of negative rates, arguing that despite a slowing economy, inflation is stable and growth will remain reasonable ahead.

"By Yereth Rosen ANCHORAGE, Alaska, March 12 (Reuters) - The Iditarod TrailSled Dog Race, a topsy-turvy slog this year marked by heavy wetsnow, occasional rain, dwindling ice and a  dog rebellion, wasexpected to conclude early on Wednesday with either an Alaskanor Norwegian musher crowned the winner. Pete Kaiser of Bethel, Alaska, was out in front early onTuesday, but only narrowly, with a 41-minute lead over defendingchampion Joar Leifseth Ulsom of Norway. The two front-runnersled a field of 42 remaining mushers, after 10 teams dropped outduring the contest. Kaiser and Liefseth Ulsom both arrived in the morning at thenative Inupiat village of White Mountain, a checkpoint 77 miles(124 km) from the finish line at the Gold Rush town of Nome.Rules require an eight-hour stop at White Mountain before thefinal push to Nome. The two contenders were expected to leavethe village late Tuesday afternoon. If he wins, Kaiser, who is Yupik, will be the first AlaskaNative Iditarod champion since 2011, when Inupiat John Bakerclaimed victory. Should Liefseth Ulsom cross the finish linefirst, he would become only the second Norwegian champion,following two previous victories by his countryman Robert Sorliein the 1,000-mile (1,600-km) Alaska race. The winner this year will be awarded a new truck and about$50,000 in cash, the top prize from a total $500,000 purse.

FRENCH MUSHER Until Monday, French-born musher Nicolas Petit of Girdwood,Alaska, had appeared to be en route to victory - until his dogsstopped along a stretch of the Bering Sea coastline, about 200miles (320 km) from Nome, and refused to go farther. Petit senthis dogs off the trail by snowmobile and officially dropped outof the race on Monday night. In third and fourth place on Tuesday were the Iditarod’s topwomen: Jessie Royer of Fairbanks, Alaska, and Aliy Zirkle of TwoRivers, Alaska. The Iditarod speed record is eight days, three hours and 40minutes, set by Mitch Seavey in 2017. This year’s race, whichbegan on March 2 in Anchorage, has been significantly slower. Higher-than-normal temperatures created soft conditions,bogging down the teams. The Bering Sea, usually coated with alayer of ice on the northern section, is almost entirely free ofice, so race officials made course alterations that slightlylengthened part of the route. Racers also had to detour aroundsome spots of open river water.

Turkey's lira lost nearly 30 percent of itsvalue against the dollar last year on concern over the centralbank's independence and worsening ties with Washington. Turkey has also been faced with consistently high inflation,which stood at 19.67 percent in February even after the centralbank raised its policy rate by a total of 11.25 percentagepoints to 24 percent last year. The forex deposits and funds of local individuals have risensteadily over the past 5 1/2 months. Total forex deposits inTurkey's banking system currently exceed 50 percent of alldeposits, according to central bank data. The long-term trend of increasing dollarisation is a signalof a decline in confidence in the lira as a store of value, saidJason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at CapitalEconomics. Last year's currency crisis raised worries over the abilityof companies to service their debt and over the effect onTurkish banks. ""The more widespread that dollarisation becomes, the risk ofproblems emerging in the banking sector will multiply,"" Tuveysaid, adding that the biggest threat would a shock thattriggered the withdrawal of forex deposits. ""In order to meet withdrawal requests, banks would be forcedto draw down their FX assets,"" he said. While the government emphasises growth in its decisions,inflation needs to come down to restore confidence in the lira,said Durmus Yilmaz, the deputy leader of the opposition IyiParty and a former central bank governor. ""The main point is that we cannot get rid of thisdollarisation trouble unless there is a real fight againstinflation,"" he said. Monetary policy would not be effective as dollarisationgrew, Yilmaz said, because the central bank cannot regulateforeign currencies.

The irony is that many key themes played out in thestatistical darkness after China's customs department suspendedfrom March its traditional detailed monthly breakdown. While some copper and aluminium insights could still begleaned from customs' continuing preliminary estimates, manyother components of China's metallic interaction with the restof the world simply ""disappeared"". Partial light has since been restored thanks to thedepartment's new website and the forensic work of colleagues atRefinitiv. Here are some of the stand-outs in terms of what the marketslargely missed at the time. Graphic on China's Imports of Refined Zinc: https://tmsnrt.rs/2TemSMt ZINC'S BULL STORY PLAYS OUT China imported 715,355 tonnes of refined zinc last year.That was the highest-ever amount and represented the secondconsecutive year of record imports. The country's net pull on the global zinc market over thelast two years has totalled 1.35 million tonnes. The only historical comparison for this sort of importappetite was 2009, when imports reached 670,000 tonnes. It's a distorted echo from the past, however. Amid the unfolding global financial crisis, Beijing'ssupport operations for its beleaguered metal producers disruptednatural arbitrage patterns and sucked in lots of zinc which thecountry didn't actually need at the time. This time around China's acute hunger for refined zincrepresents the play-out of this market's recent defining bullnarrative. Multiple mine closures and a resulting global raw materialssupply crunch hit China's smelters hard last year. Antaike, the state metals research house, estimates nationalproduction of refined zinc slumped almost five percent to 4.53million tonnes in what was the sharpest downturn since 2013. Things should change this year. Analysts at Wood Mackenzieexpect ""a substantive rise in mine supply will outstrip thegrowth in refined production and (will) result in a concentratesurplus and the replenishment of previously depleted stocks ofconcentrate"". (""Zinc - things to look for in 2019"", Jan. 28,2019) Much, however, will depend on whether China's zinc smelterscan overcome margin compression and environmental pressures toprocess that raw materials surplus into metal. Graphic on China's Net Trade in Refined Lead: https://tmsnrt.rs/2TjSvnV LEAD - UNPRECEDENTED IMPORTS China imported 128,000 tonnes of refined lead last year,bringing the cumulative total over 2017 and 2018 to 206,000tonnes. As with zinc, the only precedent for this scale of importaction was the outlier year of the global financial crisis. The country was actually a net exporter of refined lead overthe 2013-2016 period and it was again briefly in the first halfof last year before imports started accelerating from Julyonwards. And as with zinc this is a story of global raw materialsshortage and environmental crackdown within China. Rising mine production of sister metal zinc should alleviatelead's supply-chain tightness but Beijing is in no mood to liftthe environmental pressure on its lead sector. Indeed, Wood Mackenzie notes that any primary lead smelterfailing to get its Discharge Permit this year will be shut down,while the smaller-scale secondary production sector willcontinue contracting. (""Lead - 5 things to look for in 2019"",Jan. 24, 2019). Graphic on China's Alumina Trade: https://tmsnrt.rs/2TnNn2t ALUMINA - CHINA TO THE RESCUE China has historically been a net importer of alumina, theintermediate raw material used to make primary aluminium. Until last year the highest annual exports had been just292,600 tonnes in 2015. That figure mushroomed to 1.46 milliontonnes in 2018. China's huge exports of aluminium semi-fabricated productsdismay producers in the rest of the world but no-one has beencomplaining about this alumina flow. Indeed, China has effectively stepped in to plug a3.2-million tonne supply gap left by the partial outage sinceFebruary last year of the giant Alunorte alumina plant inBrazil. That gap is expected to close this year. Hydro received earlier this month approval from the state ofPara to resume full operations. A federal courtmust follow suit before it can actually do so but Alunorte'sfull return now looks a case of when not if. Graphic on China's Net Trade in Refined Tin 2008-2018: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ti156V TIN - RECORD EXPORTS BUT RAW MATERIALS CRUNCH LOOMS China exported 6,078 tonnes of refined tin last year,flipping the country to net exporter for the first time since2007. The historical comparison is telling since a previous exportstream of refined tin came to an abrupt halt at the start of2008 with the imposition of a 10 percent export tax. Since then the country has been a consistent net importer,or at least at the headline level since there have been periodswhen surplus metal has seeped into the international marketunder lesser-known trade codes. Last year's turnaround is confirmation that the export taxwas very quietly dropped at the start of 2018. The move wasunannounced and caught even Chinese players off guard. It's taken a time for trade flows to start adjusting aslocal producers look at the potential for tariff-free exportshipments. In principle, more might be expected to follow this year,given China is the world's largest refined tin producer. Whether internal supply dynamics will allow the country tocontinue exporting at this sort of rate, however, is a mootpoint. China has become heavily reliant on raw material fromneighbouring Myanmar in recent years, a previously unexpectedbonanza that may be about to disappear. Production and grades have been declining rapidly at theMyanmar mines, according to the International Tin Association(ITA). Stockpiles have been run down and old mines have beenreworked to mitigate the trend but the slowdown is evident in a25 percent slide in Chinese imports of tin concentrates lastyear. Several Chinese producers reacted by taking maintenancedowntime towards the end of 2018 with the ITA forecasting an 8percent drop in national refined production over the year as awhole. Until China's own raw materials supply chain re-adjusts toreduced flows of concentrate from Myanmar, exports of refinedmetal are likely going to be capped at relatively modest levels.(Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",RPT-COLUMN-A record-breaking year for China's metals trade: Andy Home,"last year was one of the mostinteresting in a decade for china's trade in base metals. many key themes played out in thestatistical darkness after china's customs department suspended its traditional detailed monthly breakdown. china imported 715,355 tonnes of refined zinc last year.",rpt-column-china's metals trade in the dark : andy home on what the markets missed in 2018 : andy home

""Michael, you've always been a fighter and you always willbe,"" said former Ferrari boss Jean Todt, the president of thesport's governing body the International Automobile Federation(FIA), on Twitter. Schumacher now lives a sheltered existence at the family'smansion by the shores of Lake Geneva in the town of Gland,Switzerland, with his wife Corinna and children highlyprotective of his privacy. ""You can be sure that he is in the very best of hands andthat we are doing everything humanly possible to help him,"" thefamily said in a rare statement on Wednesday that also announcedthe launch of a Michael Schumacher app. TREMENDOUS IMPACT Thursday's focus was on celebrating a champion who holds therecords for most titles and wins (91), even if Britain'sfive-time champion Lewis Hamilton is closing in. The Formula One website declared 'Schumacher Week', withstories and interviews looking back on the career of a man whoretired in 2012 after a three-year comeback with Mercedes. ""Michael has had a tremendous impact on Formula One,"" saidMercedes team boss Toto Wolff in a statement. ""Not only did he set an incredible record -- a record thatis yet to be beaten -- but he also shaped and changed the sportforever,"" added the Austrian of a driver whose Formula One debutwith Jordan at Spa in 1991 was funded by Mercedes. ""As a driver, Michael took Formula One to a whole new levelwith his attention to detail and his technical knowledge. ""He did everything with great determination, from hisengineering debriefs to his physical training, and was alwayssearching for new ways to improve his on-track performance."" Formula One's managing director for motorsport Ross Brawn, akey player in Schumacher's career at Benetton and Ferrari andalso as Mercedes boss before Wolff, spoke from the heart. ""I think one of the things I'd say about Michael fromthroughout his career is that people who worked with him neverhad a bad word to say about him,"" the Briton said in a FormulaOne podcast. ""Within the teams he worked in, he always created a greatimpression and a great loyalty."" Schumacher spent 18 seasons, over a 21-year period, inFormula One and took at least one win in 15 successive campaigns(1992-2006). Hamilton has so far done that for 12 in a row. The German's career was also clouded by controversy, hisachievements countered by the feeling that he benefited from thebest car and a subservient team mate throughout his Ferrariyears. But his talent was indisputable, particularly in wetconditions, and his mind-management and ability to gel a teamaround him set him apart. He was also a family man, fiercely guarding his privacy awayfrom the track.

"(Adds details on program, Seema Verma, analyst comment) By Caroline Humer and Michael Erman NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday said it will test allowing state Medicaid programs to limit health benefits and prescription drug coverage for some patients in return for changing how federal government contributions to the states are made. Medicaid plans currently pay for most prescription drugs. The new approach would align their coverage with that of many private health plans and Medicare prescription drug plans that typically use the threat of excluding a drug from coverage to seek lower prices from manufacturers. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said states would have to opt into the Healthy Adult Opportunity program. It said patients eligible for the program would be limited to adult beneficiaries under age 65 who are not eligible on the basis of a disability or their need for long-term care. The program is primarily targeted at the roughly one-fifth of Medicaid patients who received health coverage through the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Medicaid expansion program since 2014, CMS Administrator Seema Verma said. The program would require states to commit in advance to either a total Medicaid spending figure or a per capita spending amount in order to receive federal money, a change from the current method in which the federal government reimburses states for a percentage of actual spending, and one that could run into legal challenges. Much like private health insurers, participating states would be able to create a formulary of covered drugs, which allows them to give a drugmakers' medicine priority in exchange for lower prices. There are special protections for drugs that treat HIV and behavioral health conditions. ""This is an opportunity for states to have greater negotiating power with manufacturers,"" Verma said on a conference call with reporters. States participating in the program will be required to report key quality metrics to CMS. There are more than 71 million people currently covered under Medicaid, an important social safety net program created five decades ago and expanded by Trump's predecessor Barack Obama through the ACA, popularly known as Obamacare. Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said the program could be in violation of Federal law, which requires Medicaid funding to be open ended. ""Any capped funding arrangement will most likely be overturned in court,"" Newshel wrote in a research note. Americans' healthcare coverage has been a central issue in the 2020 presidential election. Democrats have been critical of programs like the one being proposed by the administration.

With U.S. trade duties threatening to ratchet up pressure on China's already slowing economy, its policymakers have shifted focus in recent months to growth-boosting measures, pushing banks to lend more and reducing corporate financing costs. Chinese banks extended 1.28 trillion yuan ($186.40 billion) in net new yuan loans in August, according to central bank data released on Wednesday. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted an August tally of 1.3 trillion yuan, down from July's 1.45 trillion yuan but nearly 20 percent more than the same month last year. Corporate lending fell from July, while household loans picked up sharply, suggesting banks are taking on more exposure to relatively safer consumer loans as corporate credit quality deteriorates along with the slowing economy. Corporate loans fell to 612.7 billion yuan in August from 650.1 billion yuan a month earlier. Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 701.2 billion yuan in August from 634.4 billion yuan in July. Household loans also accounted for 54.8 percent of total new loans in August, versus 43.8 percent in the preceding month. Total new bank loans in the first eight months of the year jumped nearly 19 percent from a year earlier to 11.76 trillion yuan. That is well on track to set a new full-year record, eclipsing last year's 13.53 trillion yuan. Broad M2 money supply grew 8.2 percent in August from a year earlier, central bank data showed on Wednesday. Analysts had expected M2 to rise 8.5 percent, matching July's pace. Outstanding yuan loans grew 13.2 percent from a year earlier, matching expectations and in line with July's rise. POLICY SHIFTING TOWARD STIMULUS, LOOSENING To head off a sharper slowdown in the economy and weather the blow from expanding U.S. tariffs, China is ramping up infrastructure spending and pumping ample liquidity into the financial system to guide borrowing rates lower. The central bank also is trying to encourage banks to continue lending to struggling small and mid-sized private firms, which traditionally have a tougher time accessing affordable funding than their larger, state-owned peers. But China's commercial banks are increasingly cautious. Non-performing loans jumped sharply at smaller banks in the second quarter and corporate bond defaults are on the rise, even as Beijing tries to maintain a broader clampdown on riskier lending and prevent another rapid build-up in debt. At least 13 lenders, including 10 rural commercial banks, have had their credit ratings cut or outlooks downgraded to negative since the start of 2017, according to a Reuters analysis in July.

"(Corrects spelling of S.Korea defence minister's name par 2) By Joyce Lee SEOUL, July 24 (Reuters) - U.S. national security adviserJohn Bolton met with South Korean officials on Wednesday todiscuss major bilateral issues amid South Korea's trade spatwith Japan, stalled nuclear talks with North Korea, and aregional air space dispute on Tuesday. Bolton is meeting South Korea's chief of National SecurityOffice Chung Eui-yong, Defence Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, andForeign Minister Kang Kyung-wha in Seoul to discuss issuesincluding denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and ways tostrengthen the South Korea-U.S. alliance. On his arrival in South Korea late on Tuesday, Boltontweeted that he was ""looking forward to productive meetings withthe leadership of our important ally and partner so vital toIndo-Pacific security and prosperity"". The South Koreans are expected to bring up a trade disputewith U.S. ally Japan, which has restricted exports of high-techmaterials to South Korea. Seoul has said the curbs could hurt global tech companiesincluding Apple which use South Korean semiconductorsand displays and has asked the United States to help resolve thedispute. Japan, which has denied that a dispute over compensation forSouth Koreans forced to work for Japanese occupiers during WorldWar Two is behind the export curbs, is now considering removingSouth Korea from a Japanese ""white list"" of countries withminimum trade restrictions, which would impose tougherconditions. On Tuesday, South Korean officials said their warplanes hadfired hundreds of warning shots near a Russian aircraft that waspart of what Moscow said was its first long-range joint airpatrol in the Asia-Pacific region with China, sparking a roundof diplomatic protests. The development could complicate relations and raise tensionin a region that has for years been overshadowed by hostilitybetween the United States and North Korea. Denuclearisation talks between North Korea and the UnitedStates have stalled after a second summit between U.S. PresidentDonald Trump and the North's leader Kim Jong-Un in Vietnam inFebruary broke down. Bolton met with South Korean opposition Liberty KoreaParty's floor leader Na Kyung-won early Wednesday at herrequest, Na said. Na said she told Bolton of ""the importance of the SouthKorea-U.S. alliance"" in light of the airspace incident byRussian military aircraft, and said Japan's export curbs are""not helpful"" to the trilateral cooperation between Korea, theU.S. and Japan. She did not mention Bolton's reply.

"(Adds context, shareholder details, background) Aug 13 (Reuters) - Australia's Capilano Honey Ltd said on Monday a consortium of China-focused Wattle Hill RHC Fund and Roc Partners agreed to buy the company for A$189.8 million ($138 million). The deal, which comes at a time of enormous Chinese interest Down Under, will offer the honey producer's shareholders A$20.06 per share in cash or stock, representing a premium of 28.2 percent to the stock's last close. Capilano said Wroxby Pty Ltd, which currently holds a 20.6 percent stake in the company, intends to vote in favour of the deal if there is no superior bid. Capilano shares surged as much as 27.73 percent to their highest since August 2016. Australia has seen renewed interest from Chinese and China-focused investors across sectors, including food, healthcare and energy, amid mounting trade tensions with the United States. Food and health scares in China, most recently reports of safety lapses in the production of a rabies vaccine, are driving Chinese customers and companies to scour the globe for reliable products. Two Chinese firms have bid for New Zealand honey maker Manuka Health, pricing it around $300 million, Reuters reported last month. Chinese investment has also flowed through the wine supply chain, with a flurry of relatively small purchases of Australian wine assets. In May last year, Chinese wine distributor YesMyWine made one of the largest investments with its purchase of a 15 percent stake, and a board seat along with it, in Australian Vintage Ltd , the country's fifth-largest winemaker.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-New York-April 08: Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating toTransCanada PipeLines Limited's (TCPL) proposed issuance of Canadiandollar-denominated senior unsecured notes. Proceeds from the offering are forgeneral corporate purposes. TransCanada Corporation (TRP) is the ultimate parentof the TransCanada family of companies. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A fulllist of ratings follows at the end of this release. The ratings on TCPL and TRP reflect the group's large scale and cash flowpredictability. The predictable quality of TCPL's cash flow stems from thecompany's strong portfolio of assets which generate approximately 95% of cashflows from either regulatory rate orders or long-term contracts. Theregulatory-based cash flows and the contract cash flows remove almost allcustomer-demand variability from TCPL's earnings. Concerns include execution ofa large capital investment program and rapid dividend growth rate guidance,while also improving leverage metrics. TRP expects to grow dividends by at least8% per annum through 2021. KEY RATING DRIVERS Diversity Tempers Leverage: TCPL exhibits diversity across a few parts of itsprofile and earns revenues largely on regulatory-based and long-term contractedbusinesses. The company enjoys regulatory diversity by having large operationsin natural gas pipelines subject to the National Energy Board and the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission oversight. Customer diversity exists in contractswith large energy companies such as the Independent Electricity System Operatorand the oil shippers on the Keystone Pipeline system. The current state ofsegment diversification at TCPL is part of a good execution track record. TheLiquids Pipelines segment is less than a decade old and has produced, underfoundational 20-year contracts, consistent cash flows each year since inception.The Energy segment has achieved impressive results in managing complicatedengineering and construction activities, with the recent achievement of an 88.5%availability factor at the Bruce Power nuclear power facility in the 2017-2018period. Beneficial Size & Scope: TCPL is one of the largest midstream companies in NorthAmerica. Its Natural Gas Pipelines segment transports product that fulfil overone-quarter of continental natural gas demand. TCPL's two other segments alsofeature world-scale assets that furnish stable cash flows. For instance, theEnergy segment contains the second largest nuclear power station in the world(6,400 megawatts). Additionally, 20% of western Canadian crude oil exports aretransported on the Liquids Pipelines segment's Keystone Pipeline system. Successful Execution: The rating is further supported by TCPL's development,construction and operational execution abilities. During two years ofadministering the large construction program of Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc.(CPG; IDR BBB+/Stable), execution has been successful and included work in aU.S. National Forest in 2018. The Liquids Pipelines segment has successfullyextended the reach of the base Keystone Pipeline. Furthermore, TCPL's Energysegment features numerous successfully completed ""green field"" projects and, inthe case of Bruce Power, expansions in size by bringing ""laid up"" units backinto commercial operation. High Capital Spending and Leverage: The rating considers TCPL's execution riskon its construction programs. Concerns focus on an approximately $36.6 billioncapital spending plan, of which $13.2 billion has been spent to date. Given thelarge capital spending plan, where most of the projects take over a year fromthe ground-breaking milestone to the revenue-generating milestone, leverage ishigh compared to management's target. Recent adjusted debt (debt valued at12/31/18) to EBITDA was 5.6x (FY18), slightly higher than Fitch expectations. Webelieve TRP is committed to a strong balance sheet. This commitment ishighlighted by, among other things, the company's FY18 issuance of $1.1 billionof common equity, mainly through its at-the-market program. Additionally, TRPbenefits from a healthy 35% participation rate in its dividend reinvestmentplan, translating into a reinvestment in common equity of approximately $870million in 2018. A challenge to significantly increasing EBITDA in 2019, andthereby cutting leverage, is that three projects in Mexico are currentlyreceiving payments under Force Majeure provisions. Such payments are notaccounted for by TCPL as revenues. The company expects to bring the largest ofthese projects into revenue-generating status this quarter. TCPL has decades ofexperience in making investments outside of Canada, and Fitch expects thecompany to be successful in Mexico. DERIVATION SUMMARY TRP's credit profile compares well with its peers given its scale and breadth ofoperations in Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. Construction and operating risk inthe business segments range from low-to-medium complexity, with Bruce Powerbeing the primary driver of ""medium"" risk. Regulatory risk with respect topermitting is of moderate difficulty in the current politicized environment forenergy. Fitch believes that TCPL has good relations with each of the NEB and theFERC. Among midstream companies ranked highest with respect to EBITDA from natural gastransmission pipelines, TRP is comparable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI,BBB-/Positive). Fitch expects KMI's adjusted debt to EBITDA to be approximately4.5x over the long term. TRP's leverage policy is for a long-term run-rate ofhigh 4x, and Fitch calculates TRP's FY18 adjusted debt to EBITDA at 5.6x. TRP'sIDR is currently three notches higher than KMI's, with potential for furthernotching in light of KMI's Positive Outlook. Differentiating factors include:(a) TRP's expected trough-capex period leverage is lower than KMI's, (b) TRP hasvirtually no direct commodity price risk, and (c) TRP lacks sensitivity to GDP-and commodity price-related volumetric risk. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer --Natural gas pipelines earn the returns/profit levels underlying their recentrate cases, including successful re-contracting at the U.S. pipelines; --Contracted cash flows are obtained through successful operational performanceat the Liquids Pipelines and Energy operations; --The sum of (i) growth spending for projects that will complete in 2019 to2023, (ii) recoverable maintenance capex and (iii) non-recoverable capex is$36.6 billion (of which $13.2 billion had been spent as of Dec. 31, 2018).Keystone XL is not included in this total; --Balanced funding between debt and equity. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive RatingAction --A positive rating action is not anticipated in the medium term, but adjustedleverage below 3.5x on a sustained basis could lead to a positive rating action. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative RatingAction --Adverse regulatory outcomes from any of the regulators who approve its revenuerequirements; --An acquisition that represents a change in the current business strategy ofoperating businesses that are based on cost-of-service principles or verylong-term take-or-pay contracts; --TRP-adjusted debt to EBITDA at TRP above 5.5x on a near-term basis; --New projects fail to achieve the initial returns expected, with the aggregateeffect that the company fails to keep on a path to significantly reduce adjusteddebt to EBITDA. The end-point for leverage reduction at TRP is approximately4.5x in 2019, assuming none of its current slate of preliminarily commerciallyagreed development projects reach final investment decision in or before 2019. LIQUIDITY Liquidity at TRP is adequate. As of Feb. 11, 2019, TRP had approximately $11.8billion available out of $12.8 billion committed under its revolving creditfacilities, in addition to a Dec. 31, 2018 cash balance of $446 million on itsbalance sheet. The credit facilities support commercial paper programs forseveral subsidiaries and are guaranteed at the TCPL-level. The companysuccessfully extended the maturity dates on credit facilities that were due inDecember 2018. The combined liquidity is adequate to cover debt maturities in2019, which consist primarily of subsidiary debt retirements.

Fitch currently rates the following: TransCanada Corporation --Long-Term IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured 'A-'; --Preferred stock 'BBB'. TransCanada Pipelines Limited --Long-Term IDR 'A-'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2'; --Senior unsecured rating 'A-'; --Commercial Paper rating 'F2'. TransCanada Trust --Junior subordinated notes 'BBB'.

" (In 5th bullet, corrects figure for funds' net long position to 21,650 lots, not 20,650 lots.)     CHICAGO, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures tumbled on Tuesday, with the March contract hitting its lowest since December on signs of adequate global supplies and what appeared to be fund-driven long liquidation, traders said.     * CBOT March soft red winter wheat settled down 10 cents at $5.42 per bushel after touching $5.39, the contract's lowest since Dec. 24.     * K.C.

"BEIJING, Sept 3 (Reuters) - China and the United States haveonly ""limited"" cooperation in stopping fentanyl smuggling, aChinese narcotics official was quoted as saying on Tuesday,after complaints China isn't doing enough to help fight anopioid crisis in the United States. U.S. officials say China is the main source of illicitfentanyl and fentanyl-related substances that are traffickedinto the United States, much of it through international mail.China denies that most of the illicit fentanyl entering theUnited States originates in China. U.S. President Donald Trump last month accused ChinesePresident Xi Jinping of failing to meet his promises to crackdown on the deluge of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues flowinginto the United States. China labelled that ""blatant slander"". Fentanyl is a cheap, relatively easy-to-synthesize opioidpainkiller 50 times more potent than heroin that has played amajor role in a devastating U.S. opioid crisis. Liu Yuejin, Vice Commissioner of the China NationalNarcotics Control Commission, told a news conference that Chinawas cracking down on illicit fentanyl production, statetelevision reported. ""The National Narcotics Control report states that lookingat cases, counter-narcotics law enforcement departments fromChina and the United States have for many years maintained agood cooperative relationship,"" the report cited Liu as saying. ""But cooperation on investigating and prosecutingfentanyl-related substances is extremely limited."" Since 2012, the United States has only reported ""clues"" onsix fentanyl-related smuggling cases to China, with only threeof these cases successfully cracked, the report added. Since May 1 of this year, when China tightened controls onfentanyl-related substances, China has not yet discovered asingle fentanyl-related smuggling case, Liu said. Liu reiterated previous government denials that China is thesource of most of the fentanyl smuggled into the United States. China has told the United States it needs to get its housein order when it comes to tackling fentanyl abuse, and should domore to reduce demand. The U.S. Treasury last month imposed sanctions on threeChinese men accused of illegally trafficking fentanyl, actingthree weeks after Trump accused China of reneging on pledges tostem the flood of the highly addictive synthetic opioid into theUnited States.

"(Adds details, background) MADRID, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala aims to value Spanish oil major Cepsa at up to 8 billion euros ($9.22 billion) in the company's initial public offering (IPO), according to the price range set in its prospectus on Tuesday. The deal will be the biggest stock market flotation on the Madrid exchange since Spanish airports manager Aena three years ago, helped by a rebound in crude oil prices that has lifted valuations of oil companies. Mubadala, which announced the planned Cepsa listing two weeks ago, is expected to raise about 2 billion euros with the sale of a 25 per cent stake in the Spanish company. The final share price is expected to be set on Oct. 16, with the flotation expected two days later. The listing will provide Cepsa with wider access to capital markets, Mubadala has said. Mubadala, meanwhile, is looking to invest in new sectors and geographical areas, Chief Executive Khaldoon Khalifa al-Mubarak said last month. Cepsa employs more 10,200 people and has fields in Latin America, North Africa, southeast Asia and Spain, with total production of more than 175,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent. It is also a significant player among European oil refiners, with processing capacity of 483,000 barrels a day in Spain. The floatation includes an overallotment option of 3.75 percent. If completely exercised, the option could raise an additional 300 million euros. Including 3.2 billion euros in net debt, Cepsa's enterprise value could reach up to 11.2 billion euros.

"By Jan Wolfe (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday could decide to revisit the fiercely debated question of what sort of subject matter is eligible for patent protection, practitioners said. The high court will hold a conference on Friday afternoon to consider hundreds of petitions urging it to hear appeals. Among those petitions are six relating to Section 101 of the Patent Act, a statute frequently used to revoke patents and terminate infringement cases in lower courts in recent years. Many prominent patent lawyers have argued that a 2014 Supreme Court decision on patent eligibility, Alice Corp v. CLS Bank International, has created more confusion than clarity and that the justices should revisit the issue. ""My prediction is at least one of these things gets granted,"" said Matthew Rizzolo, a partner at Ropes & Gray in Washington. Anthony Fuga, a Chicago-based Holland & Knight partner, said the case most likely to be granted is Athena Diagnostics Inc v. Mayo Collaborative Services LLC, an appeal by a Quest Diagnostics Inc subsidiary of a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision that invalidated a patent on a method of diagnosing a neurological disorder. The Federal Circuit voted 7-5 not to review a panel decision in Athena en banc, but over the course of eight separate decisions spanning 86 pages several judges called for Congress or the Supreme Court to clarify Section 101's bounds. In a court filing, the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of the Solicitor General said agreeing to hear a Section 101 case was ""amply warranted"" and that Athena was a good vehicle for doing so. The Solicitor General's brief discouraged the high court from hearing two other cases up for conference, HP Inc v. Berkheimer and Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc v. Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc, saying they were worse candidates because the outcomes in those cases were proper. ""If one of these cases is taken I would expect it to be Athena,"" said Fuga, citing the Solicitor General's brief and the pleas from the Federal Circuit judges. Fuga said it was a ""coin flip"" whether the justices would hear Athena, however, noting that the high court has denied several petitions related to Section 101 in the years since Alice. Section 101 states that ""any useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any useful improvement thereof,"" may be eligible for patent protection. U.S. Supreme Court decisions have interpreted Section 101's language as prohibiting the patenting of ""laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas."" In Alice and an earlier case, Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs, the Supreme Court laid out a two-part test for determining whether patent claims are drawn to one of those exceptions. Echoing comments by other prominent patent lawyers, Paul Michel, a retired Federal Circuit judge, said in testimony to Congress in June in a series of hearings on patent eligibility that Mayo and Alice were ""unhelpful"" and that ""the current state of eligibility must be characterized as chaotic."" The appeals at the Supreme Court are: Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc et al. v. Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc, No. 18-817. Garmin USA, Inc., et al. v. Cellspin Soft, Inc., No. 19-400.

"(Adds details on contraction, context on economy) By Mayela Armas and Corina Pons CARACAS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Preliminary data compiled by Venezuela's central bank shows the economy shrank by 16.6 percent in 2017 compared with the year before, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday, the sharpest decline on record for a country mired in crisis. The OPEC nation's economy has been in free fall following the collapse of oil prices in 2014 and the unraveling of its socialist system, leading millions of people to leave the country to escape hyperinflation and rising malnutrition. But the central bank has stopped publishing economic indicators amid what President Nicolas Maduro describes as an ""economic war"" led by businesses and political adversaries. Preliminary data being prepared by technical experts shows that oil sector activity shrank 11.3 percent in 2017 from 2016 while the non-oil sector contracted 15.2 percent, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. The International Monetary Fund has been pressuring Venezuela for weeks to provide data on economic activity, consumer prices and balance of payments, the sources said. The central bank's board of directors is interested in providing the data to the IMF, according to the sources, but it has not officially approved the figures. One of the sources said that a member of the board was seeking to ""sweeten"" the data, or alter statistics such that economic problems look less dramatic. Venezuela's Information Ministry and the central bank did not respond to requests for comment. Jesus Faria of the all-powerful Constituent Assembly this week said that the government had made initial contact with the IMF to provide the data, adding that ""we do not have the luxury of being sanctioned by the IMF, because that could lead to expulsion from the institution."" The IMF did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources did not provide consumer price data for 2017. But they said that the producer price index, which tends to move in tandem with consumer prices, rose 2,800 percent in 2017 with respect to the prior year. That is in line with data from the opposition-run legislature, which began calculating economic indicators last year after the central bank stopped publishing official figures. The legislature says the producer price index rose 2,616 percent last year, and that annual inflation in October topped 833,000 percent.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Chicago-December 03: Fitch Ratings has maintained Companhia Siderurgica Nacional's (CSN)'s Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'B-', its National Scale rating of 'BB-(bra)' and its 'B-'/'RR4' senior unsecured notes on Rating Watch Negative. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. The 'B-' rating reflects CSN's stressed financial profile during the past few years due to high leverage and elevated refinancing risks. Weak iron ore prices during 2015/2016, the severe macroeconomic recession in Brazil that led to soft demand for steel products and high interest rates all hurt CSN's cash flow and led to an unsustainable capital structure. The combination of a relatively better scenario for iron ore prices, lower local interest rates and improving steel industry in Brazil has led the company to improve its operating cash flow. These factors, coupled with a reduction in inventory days and lower capital expenditures have allowed CSN to post positive FCF over the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2018, which had been persistently negative. Despite the operational improvements, Fitch believes that asset sales remain imperative in order to effectively deleverage its strained capital structure and provide the framework to proceed with the refinancing of its bonds in the international market. Maintenance of the Negative Watch that has been in effect since December 2017 reflects the ongoing challenges CSN faces with its high refinancing risks and strained financial flexibility. The company has completed 90% of the refinancing of its bank debt during this period, one of the conditions to resolve the Negative Watch and which has provided some relief. The most significant refinancing outstanding involves its USD480 million of notes maturing on Sept. 21, 2019 and USD870 million of notes due in 2020. CSN's delivery of asset sales over the next quarter to provide it with the means to successfully meet these upcoming obligations is vital in stabilizing the rating. Should CSN encounter further delay or difficulty to execute these plans, the ratings may be downgraded. KEY RATING DRIVERS Asset Sales Critical: Delivery of asset sales are crucial in order for CSN to further improve its capital structure and for upcoming negotiations to refinance its USD480 million of notes maturing on Sept. 21, 2019 and USD870 million of notes due in 2020. CSN sold its U.S. subsidiary, Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, LLC (LLC), for USD400 million during May 2018. Completion of additional asset sales such as a sale of an iron ore prepayment agreement, sale of CSN's shares in other steelmaker Usiminas, the port terminal Tecon, and its steel operation in Germany have been sluggish. The delay in asset sales prompts concerns the company will have difficulty refinancing its cross-border issuances over the coming months. Elevated Refinancing Risks: CSN's debt amortization schedule is highly skewed to the short to medium term with amortizations of BRL4.6 billion in 2019; BRL5.9 billion in 2020 and BRL6.4 billion between 2021 and 2022. CSN reported BRL3.9 billion of cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30, 2018, a very tight position compared to its short-term debt of BRL6.4 billion and total debt of BRL30.1 billion, per Fitch's calculation. During 2019 and 2020, CSN faces BRL4.5 billion of cross-border issuances. Fitch's Base Case assumes CSN will raise cash from asset sales over the next quarter to repay its 2019 notes by the second quarter 2019 and assumes that the company will refinance part of its 2020 international bonds in the next 12 months. Leverage to Decline: Fitch's base case assumption indicates 2019's net leverage will be 5.2x with a mid-cycle price assumption of USD60 per ton. Net leverage would decline to 4.5x in 2019 under a scenario of iron ore price at USD65 and would be 3.9x if prices averaged USD70/ton. These ratios include Fitch's assumption of BRL3.3 billion of asset sales concluded in 2019, lower than management guidance. Excluding these asset sales, net leverage would be 6.1x, 5.2x and 4.5x, respectively. These net leverage ratios represent an improvement from 6.9x during 2017 and 7.2x in 2016. Improvement in Sector Fundamentals: Higher global iron ore and steel prices correspond with an upward trend in domestic steel prices, and a solid recovery in volumes has benefited CSN's operating cash flow generation. Fitch projects that CSN's local steel sales volumes will increase by 12% in 2018, after growing 5% in 2017, mostly reflecting the strong rebound in automobile production in Brazil. As a result, local steel producers have been able to apply several price increases since the mid-2016 due to strong international prices. Fitch expects an average price increase of approximately 8%-10% during 2019. Operating Cash Flow Recovery: CSN's operating cash flow (CFFO) recovery relies on increasing flat steel sales, the ability to continue passing along price increases in the domestic steel segment, manageable coal costs, and sustained iron ore prices above USD60 per ton. Fitch's base case scenario projects CSN's Fitch-adjusted EBITDA at approximately BRL4.3 billion, considering Fitch's iron ore price deck of USD65 for 2018 and EBITDA of BRL3.9 billion considering iron ore price of USD60 for 2019. If iron ore prices average USD65 during 2019, the company's EBITDA would be BRL4.5 billion. At USD70, EBITDA would be BRL5 billion. During the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2018, CSN generated BRL4.0 billion of EBITDA and BRL2.1 billion of CFFO; free cash flow (FCF) was positive BRL420 million, after dividends payment of BRL502 million, per Fitch's calculation. These results compare with BRL3.7 billion, BRL572 million and negative FCF of BRL488 million, respectively, in 2017. Capital Allocation to Drive FCF Trend: Fitch projects CSN to generate positive FCF of around USD230 million during 2018, driven by lower domestic interest rates (2018 interest burden of BRL2.2 billion vs. BRL2.6 billion in 2017), improvement in its cash conversion cycle to below 50 days compared to 67 days in 2017, and lower capex disbursements. Fitch expects FCF to revert to negative in 2019, driven by the assumption of BRL900 million of dividends to be paid next year. Absent Fitch's dividend assumptions and considering capex of BRL1.3 billion, FCF would remain positive in 2019. Working capital requirements will also return since inventories are already at low levels, and accounts receivable will be pressured in order to support continued sales expansion. Good Business Position: CSN's business position as an integrated steelmaker remains solid, underpinned by captive access to raw materials (iron ore/energy), high value-added portfolio of products and an important share in the flat steel industry in Brazil. The company has a diversified portfolio of assets with operations in the mining, steel, energy, cement and interests in railways and ports operations. The company has a poor cost competitive position in its iron ore segment per CRU, operating towards the high end of the iron ore cost curve. Given its integrated steel operations, CSN has a better position in the global HRC curve (first quartile). Largely Dependent on the Brazilian Market: CSN's operations are concentrated in Brazil (around 60% of consolidated historical revenues). As a result, its operations have been significantly impacted by the recessionary environment in the country over the last few years. Flat steel domestic sales in Brazil are strongly linked to macroeconomic performance. During 2013-2016, CSN's flat steel volume sales dropped 40%, while its steel EBITDA declined 23%. For 2017, local flat steel sales started a recovery trend exhibiting a 5% increase. During the nine months ended Sept. 30 2018, local sales grew 11%, mostly influenced by the increase in the auto production in Brazil. DERIVATION SUMMARY CSN's 'B-'/Rating Watch Negative ratings reflect its highly leveraged capital structure and elevated refinancing risks. The company's more integrated business profile and diversified portfolio of assets compares well with Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais S.A.'s (Usiminas; B+/Positive). Both issuers are highly exposed to the local steel industry in Brazil. CSN and Usiminas show much weaker business position compared to the other Brazilian steel producer Gerdau S.A (Gerdau; BBB-), which has a diversified footprint of operations with important operating cash flow generated from its assets abroad, mainly in U.S., and flexible business model (mini-mills) that allow it to better withstand economic and commodities cycles. From a financial risk perspective, Usiminas and CSN are far weaker than Gerdau, which has been able to maintain positive free cash flow generation, strong liquidity and no refinancing risks over the last few years. CSN's faces elevated refinancing risks in the short to medium term while has the challenge to effectively rebalance its capital structure trough ongoing asset sales. In contrast, after concluding its debt restructuring, Usiminas has a more manageable debt schedule amortization and balanced capital structure. CSN's first quartile position on the hot rolled coil steel cost curve compares similarly to global peers such as PAO Severstal (BBB-/Stable) and U.S. Steel Corp. (BB-/Positive), as the company benefits from its vertical integration and as well as the weak BRL. CSN and Severstal both benefit from a significant share of high value-added products, which make up their sales. CSN exhibits much weaker credit metrics when compared to Severstal (Net Debt / EBITDA greater than 1.0x) and U.S. Steel Corp. (Net Debt / EBITDA greater than 2.0x), and its significant refinancing risks reflect the differential between its rating and its global peers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer -- 12% increase in steel volumes sold during 2018; --Average iron ore price of USD65 per ton during 2018 and USD60 per ton in 2019, following Fitch's mid-price assumption; --Asset sales of BRL3.3 billion within first half of 2019; -- Repayment of 2019 cross-border notes with cash and refinancing of 2020 cross-border notes by year end 2019; --Dividends of BRL900 million in 2019. KEY RECOVERY RATING ASSUMPTIONS The recovery analysis assumes that CSN would be considered a going concern in bankruptcy and that the company would be reorganised rather than liquidated. Fitch has assumed a 10% administrative claim. Going-Concern Approach: CSN's going concern EBITDA is based on 2015 EBITDA that reflects a scenario of intense volatility in the steel industry in terms of sales volumes and prices, during a period of low iron prices. The going-concern EBITDA estimate reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganisation EBITDA level upon which Fitch's bases the valuation of the company. The EV/EBITDA multiple applied is 5.5x, reflecting CSN's strong market share in the flat steel market and it also reflects a mid-cycle multiple. Fitch applies a waterfall analysis to the post-default enterprise value (EV) based on the relative claims of the debt in the capital structure. Our debt waterfall assumptions take into account the company's total debt at Sept. 30, 2018. The waterfall results in a 42% 'RR4' Recovery Rating for senior unsecured debt. Therefore, the senior unsecured notes due 2019, 2020 and perpetual notes are rated 'B-'/'RR4'. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --Delivery of planned asset sales and detailed plan to refinance its cross-border debt; --Better than expected scenario for the local steel sales in Brazil and healthy iron ore fundamentals, which would lead improvement in FCF and net leverage to below 5.0x on sustainable basis, could lead a positive rating action. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Unsuccessful refinancing of cross-border bonds before mid-2019 in the short term; --Deterioration of the steel industry in Brazil, or inability to proceed with price increases would also pressure free cash flow generation and liquidity, and consequently the ratings. LIQUIDITY CSN reported BRL3.9 billion of cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30, 2018, a very tight position compared to its short-term debt of BRL6.4 billion and total debt of BRL30.1 billion, per Fitch's calculation. CSN's debt schedule amortization shows high concentration in the short to medium term with amortization of BRL4.6 billion in 2019; BRL5.9 billion in 2020 and BRL6.4 billion between 2021 and 2022. During 2019 and 2020, CSN faces BRL4.5 billion of maturities for cross-border issuances. CSN's debt primarily consists of prepayment export financings (19%), local bank loans (31%), senior notes (23%) and perpetual bonds (13%). The leverage at the shareholder level, which Fitch believes is high, is a concern for Fitch.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has maintained the following ratings on Negative Watch: --CSN Long-term Foreign and Local currency IDRs 'B-'; --CSN National Long-Term rating 'BB-(bra)' ; --CSN Islands XI Corp. senior unsecured Long-Term rating guaranteed by CSN 'B-'/'RR4'; --CSN Islands XII Corp. senior unsecured Long-Term rating guaranteed by CSN 'B-'/'RR4'; --CSN Resources S.A. senior unsecured USD Note Long-Term rating guaranteed by CSN 'B-'/'RR4'.

"By Chris Kirkham (Reuters) - As the FDA pressures e-cigarette firms to stamp out youth vaping, the agency faces criticism itself for failing to rein in the fast-growing industry after years of bureaucratic delays dating back to the Obama administration. Despite recent tough talk, the FDA has yet to pass any new industry-wide restrictions after two years of rapid growth in teenage vaping tied to the popularity of e-cigarettes made by Juul Labs Inc. A measure to restrict sales of flavored e-cigarette products perceived to target teens was first proposed more than a year ago and touted in September by U.S. President Donald Trump. But the proposal has gotten bogged down in negotiations between the FDA and the White House amid pressure from the industry. Vaping advocates have argued a ban on flavors could alienate potential Trump voters next year, citing polls commissioned by the e-cigarette industry. White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement the process ""is not stalled"" and that the administration ""continues to move forward on development of responsible guidelines that protect the public health and the American people."" The FDA has also delayed for years a deadline for e-cigarette makers to show their products provide a net benefit to public health. It's now set for May after a federal judge earlier this year ordered the agency to move the deadline forward. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told Reuters he believes the FDA should immediately ban sales of e-cigarettes such as Juul that continue to drive increases in youth vaping rather than wait for the applications. Public health advocates criticize the FDA for failing to assert its regulatory authority over e-cigarettes. ""It's endlessly frustrating,"" said Desmond Jenson, a senior staff attorney at the Public Health Law Center, a Minnesota legal advocacy group focused on tobacco issues. ""I can go back to FDA's press page, where there are dozens of statements talking about Juul, and not one of those resulted in products coming off the market."" The FDA declined a request for an interview with Mitch Zeller, who heads tobacco regulation, about its oversight of e-cigarettes. In written answers to questions, the agency said it would review e-cigarette firms' regulatory applications by ""weighing the deeply troubling uptake of these products by our nation's youth against the possible benefits of decreased use of combustible tobacco products by adults."" The FDA cited concerns including the dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes, and the question of whether e-cigarettes have become a ""gateway"" to traditional cigarettes for young people. The agency did not answer questions on whether it has the final say over such applications, or if the White House would get involved in its decisions on new e-cigarette regulations. The White House declined to comment on whether it would get involved in the e-cigarette applications to the FDA. The agency only got authority to regulate the tobacco industry in 2009, when President Barack Obama signed a sweeping tobacco control bill. The new law followed nearly two decades of failed attempts by the FDA and Congress to regulate the industry. The FDA first started crafting rules for e-cigarettes in 2011, but industry lobbying delayed the rule allowing FDA regulation until the final months of the Obama administration, in May 2016. When Commissioner Scott Gottlieb took the helm in 2017 as President Donald Trump’s first appointee to head the FDA, he pushed back a regulatory deadline for e-cigarette makers to prove their products provide a net benefit to public health, from 2018 to 2022. A consortium of public health groups sued the FDA over the delay and won earlier this year. A federal judge ruled in July that e-cigarette makers had to file applications by next May, citing a ""clear public health emergency."" In a written statement, the FDA said it chose to push back the deadline in 2017 because it believed e-cigarette makers could not get applications finished in time. That could have resulted in the ""immediate market exit"" of products ""that could be potentially less harmful"" than cigarettes to adult smokers. When data came out the following year showing a large increase in teenage e-cigarette use, the agency ""revisited our policies in this area,"" the agency said. Gottlieb defended his tenure at the agency in an interview, saying he raised public awareness about teen e-cigarette use, cracked down on e-cigarette makers using kid-friendly flavors and packaging, conducted unannounced inspections at Juul's San Francisco headquarters and proposed restrictions on flavored cigars. ""There was a lot of action there,"" he said.",FDA under fire for years of delays on e-cigarette regulation,the fda has yet to pass any new industry-wide restrictions after two years of rapid growth in teenage vaping tied to the popularity of e-cigarettes made by juul labs inc. a measure to restrict sales of flavored e-cigarette products perceived to target teens was first proposed more than a year ago and touted in september by president donald trump. the proposal has gotten bogged down in negotiations between the fda and the white house amid pressure from the industry.,u.s . fda under fire for failing to rein in fast-growing e-cigarette industry
"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-New York/Monterrey-December 20: Increased investment in financialtechnology (fintech) and innovation by Mexican banks as a core strategy willsupport the credit fundamentals of rated banks in the medium term, Fitch Ratingssays. Mexican banks are well positioned to absorb the near-term costs associatedwith greater fintech investment, which could lead to greater efficiencies,reduced cyber risks and new products and services. To the extent that these investments lead to increased customer retention andprofitability and/or enable incumbent banks to compete with smaller fintechcompanies, Fitch views them as credit positive. However, the expected economicslowdown, inflationary pressures, prevailing uncertainty and a sustaineddecrease in investor and consumer confidence could rapidly develop and delay theadvances of such investments in technology. Banks have been directing more technology spending toward online platforms,specifically infrastructure and IT buildout. This aims to grow online productsand services while reducing focus on brick and mortar branches.  Technologyspending accounted for 4.8% of operating expenses on average for Mexican banksas of 3Q18, up from 4.0% from 2012-2017, according to local financialregulator, Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (CNBV).  Banks have adopted different strategies, with some creating their own financialservices platforms and others developing offerings and platforms in partnershipwith fintech companies. The largest banks have driven the investmentin technology. In 2017, BBVA Bancomer announced a USD1.5 billion/MXN31.5 millionfive-year annual technology investment. In 2016, Citibanamex announcedtechnology spending of USD1.2 billion/MXN25 billion over the next fouryears. Also, Santander announced recently an investment of USD740million/MXN15.4 billion over the next three years. Increased risks of cyber attacks and new regulations have also driven investmentin technology and infrastructure, as Mexican banks have exhibited vulnerabilityto such risks. The Latin American financial system is a major target of cybercrime with attacks costing approximately $809 million annually, according to theOrganization of American States. An April 2018 cyber attack in Mexico is estimated to have cost the industryapproximately USD20 million /MXN400 million pesos, according to Central Bank(Banxico). While the losses were relatively low as a percentage of profits anddeposits, the incident highlighted the importance of robust informationtechnology security for Mexican banks.  As a response, CNBV has increased rules to strengthen the security of the banks'information, which should help contain and remediate possible security breaches. Banks are now required to have a chief information security Officer, implementdetailed security information plans, and to report any incident on bankinginfrastructure and action plans. Technology spending has also been directed at updating existing branches anddeveloping smart ATMs and functional mobile platforms. Branch growth in Mexicohas slowed in recent years, increasing 0.5% YOY as of September, down from anaverage of 1.35% in the previous six years. However, ATMs increased 6.3% YOY inSeptember, up from the 4.3% annual increase of the past five years.  Latin America tends to lag developed markets in embracing technology for bankingoperations, which should support the continued use of branches by customers overthe medium term. Branches are still the primary means banks offer products andservices to customers. However, there is a clear trend among the largest Mexicanbanks of transitioning investments and operations toward digital bankingservices.    Contact: German Valle, CFA Associate Director, LATAM Financial Institutions +52 81 8399 9166Fitch Mexico, S.A. de C.V.  Prol.

The second explosion, detected only by infrasonic airpressure sensors and not by the seismic monitors that pick upmovements in the ground, was likely from an airborne rocketpowered by radioactive fuel, the Norsar agency said. Russia's state nuclear agency, Rosatom, on Aug. 10 said theaccident involved ""isotope power sources"" but did not givefurther details. Russia's Ministry of Defence did not immediately respond toa request for comment when contacted by Reuters on Friday. Rosatom has acknowledged that five of its workers werekilled in the Aug. 8 explosion near the White Sea in farnorthern Russia. Two military personnel were also reported tohave been killed. There has been contradictory information about theaccident's consequences. Russia's Defence Ministry initiallysaid background radiation remained normal, while the stateweather agency said radiation levels had risen. Norway's DSA nuclear safety authority said on Aug. 15 it hadfound tiny amounts of radioactive iodine near Norway's Arcticborder with Russia, although it could not say whether it waslinked to the Russian accident. Norsar's detection of a second blast was first reported byNorwegian newspaper Aftenposten on Friday. ""We registered two explosions, of which the last onecoincided in time with the reported increase in radiation,""Norsar Chief Executive Anne Stroemmen Lycke told Reuters, whileadding that this likely came from the rocket's fuel. ""Both blasts were registered on our infrasound system.

"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, acolumnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's imports of U.S. energy: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ylrQyl By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 30 (Reuters) - China's purchaseof some U.S. soybeans is being viewed as a tentative sign of alittle détente in the dispute between the world's two largesteconomies, but real progress would be a resumption of what hadbeen a burgeoning energy trade. U.S. and Chinese negotiators are meeting for two days oftalks in Shanghai starting on Tuesday amid modest expectationsfor progress to resolve the trade imbroglio that has resulted intit-for-tat tariffs being imposed on billions of dollars worthof imports and exports. One of the areas where some positive movement has been seenis China's commitment to buy more U.S. agricultural produce,soybeans in particular. U.S. government data released on Monday showed soybeanexports picking up, with nine bulk U.S. soybean shipmentscarrying about 600,000 tonnes inspected for export to China inthe week ended July 25, the most for a single week sincemid-February. As positive as this may sound, China is still buyingconsiderably less than it used to from the United States.Soybean purchases in the 2018/19 season are expected to fall toaround 14.3 million tonnes, the least in 11 years and well below27.7 million tonnes in 2017/18. About 4 million tonnes of that still has to be shipped, andmay be rolled over into the next marketing year, which runs fromSeptember to August. What's clear is that U.S. soybean exports to China are downsharply in volume terms, and also in value terms given the slumpin soybean prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Soybean futures ended at 905 U.S. cents a bushel on Monday,up from the year low of 803 cents in May, but also 16% below thethree-year peak of 1,078 cents, reached in May last year justprior to the start of President Donald Trump's trade fight withChina. In dollars per tonnes terms, soybeans are around $333 atonne, meaning the 600,000 tonnes approved for export has avalue of about $200 million. In contrast, U.S. crude oil exports to China for July areestimated by Refinitiv to be 8.1 million barrels, worth around$494 million, assuming a price of $61.07 a barrel, which is thecurrent level of physical West Texas Intermediate cargoes inHouston, as assessed by commodity price reportingagency Argus. July is likely to be the strongest month for Chinese importsof U.S. crude since August last year when 10.9 million barrelsarrived. However, at about 261,000 barrels per day (bpd), July'simports are still well below the 344,000 bpd rate of the firstsix months of last year. If U.S. crude exports to China could recover to the levelsseen in the first half of last year, it would be worth around$20.1 million a day, or $7.34 billion a year. LNG, COAL MAROONED It's worth noting that crude imports by China from theUnited States aren't subject to any additional tariffs, and thismay help explain the renewed interest in purchasing cargoes seenin July. But two energy products are subject to import tariffs, withliquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal being slugged with a 25%import tax. Both LNG and coal had been enjoying strong growth in tradeprior to the tariff war and both have yet to show anysignificant recovery. China has imported just three LNG cargoes this year, oneeach in January, February and March, according to Refinitivdata. This is down from 25 cargoes totalling 1.73 million tonnesin the first half of last year. In coal, there has been some buying of U.S. cargoes, withtwo vessels carrying about 152,000 tonnes of the fueldischarging in July. This is likely coking coal used in steel making and it isbelieved that some importers may have been able to obtain tariffexemptions for coal imports. However, coal imports are still way below the first half oflast year, when 2.09 million tonnes were imported, for a monthlyaverage of about 349,000 tonnes. And the first half of 2018 was already weaker than the sameperiod in 2017, when 4.03 million tonnes of U.S. coal made itsway to China, a monthly average of about 671,000 tonnes. What remains clear is that the area with the strongestgrowth potential for U.S. exports to China, namely energy,remains well below potential and subject to the success orotherwise of efforts to resolve the trade dispute. A modest tick higher in soybean purchases may make for agood sound bite, but the real action will be if China agrees toresume buying U.S. crude, LNG and coal in meaningful volumes.

"(Adds ECB's pledge to take appropriate measures, details on virus spread; updates markets) By Ann Saphir March 2 (Reuters) - Traders on Monday piled into bets the U.S. Federal Reserve will deliver a big dose of stimulus starting this month amid mounting concern over the economic impact from the coronavirus and indications that global central banks are readying a monetary rescue. Pricing in futures tied to the Fed's policy support a 100% chance of a half percentage-point rate cut at the Fed's March meeting, and another half a percentage point-cut by July. The bets reflect rising global expectations that global central banks will take coordinated action to fend off the worst effects of a world economic slowdown as factories and schools close and public events are canceled in efforts to slow the virus' spread. They follow a pledge by Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday to ""act as appropriate"" to support the economy; one by Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Monday that he would ""strive to stabilize"" markets roiled by virus fears; and one from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde late on Monday that the bank would ""stand ready to take appropriate and targeted measures"" to address risks. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday also renewed his call for the Fed to lower interest rates, tweeting that the central bank has been ""slow to act."" Finance ministers of seven big economies, and their central bankers, will meet by conference call on Tuesday to discuss possible coordinated action. There are doubts about how effective such action could be. That is partly because of the nature of the threat: Central bank and fiscal policy can boost demand by lowering the cost of borrowing and putting money in people's wallets. But they cannot repair disrupted global supply chains or convince people to fly, attend meetings or even go to school, especially if local governments or companies bar such activities. The challenge for monetary policy also comes from the fact that interest rates globally are already at low levels. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, which have pushed interest rates below zero, may be particularly challenged to find ways to cushion their economies from the effects of the coronavirus.

"    * Graphic: World FX rates in 2020 https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E  (Adds details, updates prices)     By Karen Brettell     NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - The greenback dropped and riskier currencies, including the Australian dollar, outperformed on Tuesday as risk appetite improved on hopes that lockdowns may be slowing the spread of the coronavirus in some countries.     Sterling also rose a day after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved into intensive care due to worsening coronavirus symptoms.     Analysts said the British currency is benefiting from the increased risk appetite that is weighing on the U.S. dollar. Johnson's condition, while a concern, is also unlikely to mean a change in the government's policy direction in fighting the virus.      “Despite the sad news about the UK PM Johnson, fatalities in the UK remain relatively low and slowed for the second day, although the apex is still thought to be about 10 days away,” Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, said in a report.     “High-frequency data on coronavirus infections and death rates continue to stabilize,” Thin said.     In Spain and Italy, which account for over 40% of the world's fatalities, the death rate has been declining for several days, and public discussion has turned to how and when to ease weeks of drastic curbs on personal and economic activity.     New York state, the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus, is nearing a plateau in number of patients hospitalized, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday, a hopeful sign even as deaths in his state and neighboring New Jersey hit single-day highs.     The dollar was last down 0.81% versus a basket of currencies at 99.92.     The Australian dollar jumped 1.54% to $0.6180.     Sterling gained 0.93% to $1.2343.     The euro rose 0.98% to $1.0897.     The dollar was down 0.40% against the yen at 108.76 yen.     Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday declared a state of emergency to fight coronavirus infections in major population centres and rolled out a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package to soften the economic blow.     Action by central banks to ease a scramble for dollars that was seen in recent weeks has also helped bring some calm to markets.     ""We've got a nice decline in volatility across forex and equity markets,"" said Kenneth Broux, FX strategist at Societe Generale.

"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed arehis own) By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Investors bought crude oilfutures and options at the fastest rate for almost six months inthe week to Feb. 12. Hedge fund managers are becoming steadily more bullish onthe outlook for oil prices as Saudi Arabia makes deep cuts inproduction, sanctions hit Venezuela and Iran, and the U.S. andChina inch towards a trade deal. Hedge funds and other money managers were net buyers of 32million barrels of Brent crude futures and options in the weekto Feb. 22, according to position records published by ICEFutures Europe. Portfolio managers have been net buyers of Brent in nine outof the last 10 weeks, boosting their net position by a total of130 million barrels since Dec. 4. Last week saw the largestpurchases so far. Earlier in the current cycle most position-building camefrom closing previous bearish short positions, but the balanceshifted in the most recent week with most accumulation frominitiating new bullish long positions. Fund managers opened 29 million barrels of new longpositions while cutting short positions by 3 million barrels inthe week to Feb. 12. Funds now hold a net long position of 266 million barrels inBrent, up from 136 million at the start of December, thoughstill far below the almost 500-million-barrel position at theend of September. Similar position-building is evident in European gasoil,where funds were net buyers of 11 million barrels of futures andoptions in the week to Feb. 12. Portfolio managers have been net buyers of gasoil for sixconsecutive weeks, with total purchases amounting to 38 millionbarrels. Like Brent, last week’s purchases of gasoil contracts werethe largest so far, and the balance has shifted from shortcovering to initiating new long positions. Saudi Arabia has eased concerns about oversupply by actingas swing producer, cutting output promptly despite poorcompliance from other members of the Organization of thePetroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known asOPEC+. U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have also removedsignificant volumes of oil from the market, especially heavygasoil-rich crudes, adding to the sudden tightening of thesupply side. At the same time, traders have become more optimistic tradenegotiations between the United States and China will avoid theimposition of new tariffs on March 2 and avert a globalrecession, shoring up demand. While oil consumption growth may not accelerate, avoidingtariffs and a recession would ensure it does not slow anyfurther, easing fears about an oversupplied oil market in 2019. Record hedge fund sales forced an abrupt change in strategyby OPEC+ in the fourth quarter as the global economy and oilconsumption outlook deteriorated. But now the producer group has shifted course, hedge fundbuying has accelerated the recent rise in Brent prices,providing Saudi Arabia with an early payoff for production cuts,and validating OPEC+ strategy. And because hedge fund positions tend to be concentrated incontracts nearest to maturity, which offer the best liquidity,buying has also accelerated the shift in the calendar spreadsfrom contango to backwardation. Provided the United States and China can avoid another roundof tariffs, and the global economy skirts recession, the balanceof price risks is likely to remain tilted towards the upside.

"(Adds additional injury reported) By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. vehicle safety regulators on Tuesday said they had ordered a suspension of passenger operations for 16 autonomous shuttles operated by Toulouse, France-based EasyMile after a passenger was injured in an unexplained braking incident. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said operation of the battery-powered buses in 10 U.S. states, including Utah, Texas, Colorado, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, California and Virginia, would be suspended pending an examination of ""safety issues related to both vehicle technology and operations."" NHTSA added it ""will continue to work with all affected parties, including EasyMile and local authorities, to evaluate potential future vehicle operations, consistent with applicable legal requirements and public safety."" EasyMile did not immediately comment. This month, the city of Columbus, Ohio, announced what EasyMile called the deployment of the first public self-driving shuttle in a residential area. Two EasyMile shuttles had been servicing a 2.9-mile (4.7 km )route at speeds of up to 25 miles (40 km) per hour, the company said. EasyMile said a human operator rides aboard each vehicle with access to driving controls at all times. Ohio media outlets reported a woman fell on the cube-like shuttle and was injured last week after a sudden stop, prompting a halt to the service. In July, several news outlets in Utah reported a 76-year-old state employee was injured and required medical assistance at a local hospital when the EasyMile shuttle he was in came to an abrupt stop. A Utah official told the Deseret News the maximum speed was reduced after the incident and the company told media outlets it added signs to warn riders the vehicles make sudden stops. The company told the newspaper the passenger shuttle in Utah ""stopped abruptly in response to a detected obstacle, as it is programmed to do."" Earlier this month, the city of Gainesville, Florida, began using an EasyMile driverless shuttle in the city's downtown. It runs on a pre-planned route starting on Southwest 2nd Avenue and ending on the University of Florida campus. Privately held EasyMile, founded in 2014, has shuttles in use around the world.

"(Fixes dateline) By Amlan Chakraborty NEW DELHI, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Shafali Verma was not exactly trying to be a rebel when she began training with the local boys in the north Indian city of Rohtak as a precocious 10-year-old. In a region where girls pursuing outdoor sports are often frowned on, it was more out of compulsion that she slugged it out with boys in her bid to play cricket for India, a dream she shared with her father Sanjeev. Every outing meant new bruises from the bowlers but the 15-year-old, who got her maiden India call-up for this month's Twenty20 series against South Africa, reckons it was probably a blessing in disguise. ""It was a struggle initially, playing against the boys,"" short-haired Verma, who plays as a swashbuckling opener, told Reuters from Rohtak. ""I often got hit in the helmet. On a few occasions, they even smashed my helmet grille. But there was no question of giving up. ""They never treated me with kid gloves because I'm a girl. And I always tried to give it back to them. Guess that's how I developed my hard-hitting batting style."" Verma's power-hitting was her ticket to the Velocity team in the Women's T20 Challenge played alongside the Indian Premier League in May. There she shared the dressing room with the likes of England's World Cup-winning all-rounder Danielle Wyatt, who termed Verma as the next ""superstar"" of Indian cricket. It also meant mixing with role model and Velocity skipper Mithali Raj, who has been the face of women's cricket in the country since her India debut two years before Verma was born. Raj's decision to quit T20 triggered Verma's maiden call-up and many saw it as a passing of the baton. None of it would have been possible but for Sanjeev's dogged determination for his daughter to play for India, despite living in Haryana, a state notorious for its male bias and skewed sex ratio. ADAMANT DAD ""I was lucky to have an upbringing that's so different from most girls of my age. Many scoffed at the idea of a girl playing an outdoor sport with boys, but dad was adamant,"" Verma said of her father, a jeweller. ""Despite the discouragement, dad gave me everything that he would give to my elder brother. ""Even after I started playing, people said girls have no future in cricket. But dad shielded me from any cynicism and asked me to focus on cricket only."" It was, however, batting great Sachin Tendulkar's arrival in Rohtak for his Ranji Trophy swansong that really planted the seed of ambition in Verma. She was part of the sea of humanity that gathered at Bansi Lal stadium in 2013 to get a glimpse of the retiring maestro. ""So many people to watch a cricketer, I was just dumbstruck. I asked dad if it could happen to me and he said 'If you work hard, nothing is impossible.' ""I took it to heart and have since been working hard."" Verma, who trains at Rohtak's Ram Narain Cricket Club, has been chosen for the first three Twenty20s of the five-match series against South Africa, and the youngster is determined to nail her place in the side before flourishing across formats. ""I want to score a lot of runs and cement my place in the Twenty20 team. I also want to play in ODIs,"" she said. ""I think I can play across formats without really overhauling my technique.""

"JAKARTA, March 8 (Reuters) - Three Indonesian soldiers werekilled after a clash with dozens of rebels in the easternprovince of Papua, the military said late on Thursday, thelatest deaths amid high tensions and violence in the restiveregion. Papua, a former Dutch colony and the western part of NewGuinea island, was incorporated into Indonesia after a widelycriticised U.N.-backed referendum in 1969. A long-running separatist movement in the region has seen anincrease in violence in recent months. A team of 25 soldiers was ambushed by up to 70 ""armedcriminals"" carrying military-standard weapons and traditionalweapons, the Indonesian army said in a statement. ""The team fought back until they were able to drive thearmed criminal group back into the forest. Three soldiers diedin the attack,"" said the statement.

Also helping the market were easing concerns over tensions between the United States and Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump refrained from ordering more military action, and Iran's foreign minister said the missile strikes on Iraqi bases that house U.S. forces had ""concluded"" Tehran's response. Apple Inc gained 2.1% on twin support from data showing iPhone sales jumped more than 18% in China in December, as well as a price target hike by Jefferies on expectations of a strong finish to 2019. The S&P 500 technology sector rose 1.1%, the top gainer among sectors. The financial index ended up 0.77% after bullish brokerage comments on Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc ahead of their earnings next week. On trade, China's commerce ministry said Vice Premier Liu He will sign a Phase 1 deal in Washington next week. Trump said his administration will start negotiating the Phase 2 trade agreement soon but that he might wait to complete any agreement until after November's presidential election. ""Some of the things that have been worrying the market have gotten pushed to the side of the table,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Investors have been closely monitoring tensions between the United States and Iran after the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general last week and Iran's retaliatory measures this week. Among the day's decliners was the department store operator Kohl's Corp, which slid 6.5% after reporting lower holiday season sales and warning of full-year earnings coming in at the bottom end of an already lowered forecast. Smaller rival J.C. Penney Co Inc tumbled 10.8% after disappointing same-store sales numbers. With the fourth-quarter earnings season kicking off next week, analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies to drop 0.6% in their second consecutive quarterly decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 78 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 152 new highs and 14 new lows.

"(Adds quotes, detail, background) HELSINKI, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Finland's parliament approved the nomination on Tuesday of 34-year-old Social Democrat Sanna Marin as the world's youngest serving prime minister. Out of the parliament's 200 members, 99 voted in favour and 70 against her nomination. Thirty deputies were absent. ""Within four years we won't complete Finland but it can become better... I want to build a society in which every child can become anything and in which every human being can live and grow old with dignity,"" Marin wrote on Twitter. Finland's government resigned last week after the Centre Party said it had lost confidence in Social Democrat Prime Minister Antti Rinne over his handling of a postal strike. After parliament's approval, Finland's president was expected to nominate Marin's five-party coalition cabinet, consisting of 12 female and 7 male ministers. But behind the festivities, deep divisions remained between the main coalition partners, Marin's Social Democrats and the Centre Party. Marin will struggle to defend her leftist views against the Centre Party, which wants action to boost Finnish employment to pay for the costly welfare state. Strikes continued as she took office. Katri Kulmuni, chairwoman of the Centre Party which holds the balance of power in parliament, defended her decision to oust the outgoing prime minister Antti Rinne, accusing him of taking the employees' side in recent labour market disputes. Before his resignation, Rinne defended the publicly-owned postal service's employees in their labour dispute by saying their employment conditions would not be trampled while his government was in office. ""It became sort of an habit to flag in advance in favour of one side, in matters which should be dealt with cool impartiality,"" Kulmuni wrote in a long post on Facebook.

"(Recasts to lead on Venezuela selling shares) CARACAS, March 3 (Reuters) - Venezuela will sell some of its shares in the CAF Latin American development bank to pay down its debt with the lender, according to an opposition lawmaker who posted a copy of the resolution on Twitter on Tuesday. The sale was approved at a meeting of the CAF's board in Buenos Aires on Tuesday, said two opposition lawmakers and a member of a committee named by the opposition to restructure the country's debt, who warned that the move would jeopardize the crisis-stricken nation's economic recovery. ""We have learned that the CAF wants to buy shares from Venezuela equivalent to our country's debt, to clean its balance sheet and wipe out the debt,"" Julio Borges, a lawmaker living in exile and serving as opposition leader Juan Guaido's chief overseas representative, wrote on Twitter earlier on Monday. In December, Venezuela failed to pay the CAF some $400 million in outstanding debt, prompting rating agencies to downgrade the lender. The OPEC country has been behind on its debt to the Caracas-based CAF since 2017, but the lender rolled over the debt twice. Angel Alvarado, an opposition lawmaker who serves on the National Assembly's finance committee and published the resolution on Twitter, said the CAF approved the measure under a program for ""exceptional situations"" that allows countries to sell shares if there is a payment delay of more than 60 days. He added that the fund gave six months for the operation to be completed, and that countries including Colombia, Bolivia, Paraguay, Ecuador and Argentina had approved the measure. Alvarado had argued that instead of allowing Venezuela to sell its shares, the CAF should start restructuring the country's debt. The CAF did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither Venezuela's information nor finance ministries immediately responded to requests for comment. Venezuela has been behind on its debt to the Caracas-based CAF since 2017, but the lender rolled over the debt twice. Last year, the CAF could not roll over the debt because of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's central bank, part of Washington's efforts to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro. The United States and dozens of other countries recognize Guaido, chief of the opposition-held congress, as the legitimate president. Venezuela is undergoing a severe economic crisis marked by hyperinflation, chronic shortages of basic goods, and collapsing public services. The opposition is hoping for significant investments from multilateral development banks like the CAF to rebuild the economy should Maduro leave office.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): Short-Term Ratings Criteria https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10073011 Fitch Ratings-London-May 02: Fitch Ratings has published the final revisedcriteria applicable for short-term ratings across its corporate, financialinstitution and public finance portfolio. This concludes a major review of thefunction and utility of our short-term rating scale that began in August 2018,and a broad-based market dialogue, which has helped shape our approach to ashort-term scale for today's capital markets. The revised criteria amend our correspondence table between Long- and Short-TermIssuer Default Ratings (IDR) to provide a substantially more differentiatedanalytical view of short-term risk between issuers. This expands the number oflong-term ratings that can correspond to more than one short-term rating fromthree to five, by permitting Long-Term IDRs of 'A' to correspond to 'F1+' (inaddition to the existing 'F1' mapping) and Long-Term IDRs of 'BBB+' tocorrespond to 'F1' (in addition to the existing 'F2' mapping). The new criteria also take advantage of the significantly greater granularityevident in our asset class criteria than was available at the originalintroduction of the short-term scale, and propose specific short-term orientedfactors that will be used to distinguish between short-term ratings at crossoverpoints. We will place the short-term ratings of all issuers whose ratings we believewill be impacted by the change in criteria Under Criteria Observation (UCO) overthe coming days. UCO assignments will be published by asset class and region,and be available at www.fitchratings.com.  More information on short-term creditwill be available from our Short-Term Credit portal atyour.fitchratings.com/short-term-credit-2019. No long-term ratings are affected by this criteria change. We aim to completefull implementation of the criteria, and resolution of all UCO designationswithin six months of the designation.

"By Umit Bektas GAZIANTEP, Turkey, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Missing fragments from one of Turkey's most striking ancient treasures, the haunting, wide-eyed ""Gypsy Girl"" mosaic, have returned home more than half a century after they were plundered and smuggled to the United States. On Saturday, the returned pieces went on display alongside the nearly 2,000-year-old mosaic of the girl, whose piercing gaze and dishevelled hair have become a symbol of Turkey's southeastern city of Gaziantep. Turkish archaeologists discovered the mosaic 20 years ago during an excavation of the old city of Zeugma, founded by one of Alexander the Great's generals, near the modern city of Gaziantep. They also realised that several accompanying pieces had already been looted. Those pieces had been smuggled out of the country in the 1960s and bought by Bowling Green State University in Ohio in the United States, which displayed them until 2012 when their true provenance was established and Turkey asked for their return. The university initially asked Turkey to buy them back, a request which Ankara rejected, according to Sedat Gulluoglu, Turkey's tourism ministry attache in the United States. After more than five years of talks, an agreement was signed for their return. ""The university has signed off on a very important and significant cooperation by returning these pieces to our country as goodwill,"" Gulluoglu said by email. He added that Turkey would provide the university with exact replicas of the mosaics to display. The old city of Zeugma, on the Euphrates river, flourished under Greek and then Roman rule before it was destroyed in war in the 3rd century AD. The 15 square metre (160 square foot)Gypsy Girl mosaic is the most prominent symbol of that history. On Saturday, the pieces were put on exhibit at the Zeugma Mosaic Museum in Gaziantep in a ceremony to celebrate their return, before which a song composed to celebrate the homecoming of the mosaic pieces was played by a harp artist. Turkey's Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, who lifted a cover to unveil the mosaic as visitors poured in to see the artwork, told Reuters the returned pieces would greatly contribute to tourism in Turkey and Gaziantep. ""It is a very important day for Turkey. A six-year process has been completed and our pieces have returned where they were born,"" Ersoy said. Gaziantep mayor Fatma Sahin said putting the full mosaic back together was a national triumph. ""It returned to Gaziantep, to its nation,"" Sahin told Reuters. ""The Gypsy Girl has been reunited with her family.""

"* Doctors say Lombardy management errors exacerbated crisis * Health ministry sends inspectors to Milan care home * Lombardy official defends care home actions (Adds latest death toll, fatalities amongst doctors) By Crispian Balmer ROME, April 7 (Reuters) - Doctors in Lombardy, the Italian region hardest hit by the coronavirus epidemic, have criticised local officials for their handling of the crisis and said the mistakes they made should be a lesson for everyone. A total of 17,127 people have died from the virus in Italy, the most anywhere in the world, with Lombardy accounting for 55% of the tally. The region also accounts for 39% of the country's 135,586 confirmed cases. The particularly large death toll in Lombardy, the wealthiest region in Italy, has raised eyebrows, with local officials suggesting that both the high urban density and considerable elderly population might have played a part. However, a damning letter by senior doctors, including the heads of 11 provincial health authorities within Lombardy, said failures in the region's health system had exacerbated the greatest emergency Italy has faced since World War Two. Amongst the failings they highlighted was a lack of protective clothing for medical staff - a regular source of anger since the outbreak emerged on Feb. 21. ""This determined the death of many colleagues, the illness of many of them and the probable and involuntary spread of the contagion, especially in the early stages of the epidemic,"" said the letter, which was posted on the website of the national federation of doctors, surgeons and orthodontists. The federation says 94 medics have died in the outbreak, many in Lombardy, which is run by the far-right League party. There was no immediate comment from Lombardy officials. The medics bemoaned an ""absence of strategies"" in tackling the crisis, a lack of good data and limited testing as the virus spread. This ""greatly underestimated the number of patients and, to a lesser extent, the number of dead"", they wrote. While the neighbouring region of Veneto engaged in widespread testing in a known coronavirus hotspot, Lombardy only tested the seriously ill arriving for treatment in hospital, saying they did not have the capacity for wider checks. CARE HOMES The letter took aim at the management of nursing homes, where hundreds of people have died without ever being tested. The doctors said in the province of Bergamo alone, 600 of the 6,000 pensioners under care had died. Italy's health ministry announced on Tuesday it was sending inspectors to Milan's largest nursing home, Pio Albergo Trivulzio, where more than 100 people have died since March. A photograph of nine bodies in the home's mortuary was published on the front page of La Repubblica newspaper on Tuesday, with another showing its chapel full of coffins. Lombardy's top health official, Giulio Gallera, rejected media allegations that the region had allowed hospitals to send infected patients to local care homes without proper protection in an effort to free up badly needed space in packed wards. ""We always acted for the good of everyone in an extraordinary emergency and we will not let anyone cast aspersions on the serious, rigorous work we have carried out,"" he said on Facebook. He did not refer to the doctors' letter. Italy's healthcare system is decentralized with regions having control over the money that goes to hospitals within their own borders. Lombardy has focused on developing a dual private-public network of high-performing hospitals, but critics say this was done at the expense of grassroots medical care.

"DUBLIN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Ryanair defended on Friday its handling of an incident in which a passenger shouted racist abuse at an elderly black woman, saying cabin crew had not been aware of the nature of his comments until after the flight. British police opened an investigation after footage of the man's tirade went viral over the weekend, with the airline facing criticism because flight attendants moved the woman to a different seat and allowed the man to fly. But in a statement, the Irish airline said cabin staff were at the time working on the assumption that they were dealing with an argument between two passengers, and did not know the man had used racist language. ""Ryanair's Spanish cabin crew were aware of an argument between these two passengers during the boarding process, but were not aware of ... racist comments that were made,"" Ryanair said. ""We again extend our very sincere apologies to this passenger for the regrettable, and unacceptable remarks that were made to her by an adjacent passenger,"" the statement said. The company added that once it had seen the video, it immediately reported the racist abuse to Essex Police. The man, who has not been identified, insulted the woman after complaining that she had inconvenienced him as he tried to reach his seat on the Barcelona to London flight a week ago. Ryanair said cabin crew offered to move the woman to a seat adjacent to her daughter, which it said was normal procedure to defuse what they thought was a row between the passengers, and that she accepted the offer. The woman was asked if she was ""Okay"" after she moved seats and she said she was, the statement said.

"By Tina Bellon NEW YORK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court in a 2-1decision on Monday reinstated a 2006 lawsuit by a woman whoblamed her cardiovascular injuries on Merck & Company Inc'sdiscontinued inflammation drug Vioxx, finding her claims werenot time-barred under Missouri law. The majority of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panelheld that Missouri's five-year statute of limitations forpersonal injury claims did not begin to run before 2002 whenVioxx's adverse effects became widely accepted in the scientificcommunity. The panel mainly relied on a 2006 decision (Powel v.Chaminade Coll. Preparatory, Inc) by the Missouri Supreme Court,which stipulated that the limitations statute begins to run, notwhen the actual wrong was done, but when the damage sustainedwas ""capable of ascertainment."" Circuit Judges Raymond Gruender and Steven Grasz, who formedthe majority in the case, concluded that mere knowledge amongsome scientists about a link between Vioxx and cardiovascularrisks was not sufficient as a matter of law to place plaintiffJo Levitt on notice of her potential claims. Levitt began taking Vioxx in 1999 and sufferedcardiovascular injuries in 2000, undergoing a double coronarybypass surgery. Her doctor continued to prescribe Vioxx until2002, around the time Merck changed its label to disclose a riskof such injuries associated with Vioxx. Merck manufactured and distributed Vioxx from 1999 until2004, when it took the drug off the market. Vioxx was indicatedfor the treatment of patients with arthritis and other chronicpain and inflammatory conditions. But the long-term use of the drug became associated withhigher risks of heart attacks and strokes, information Merckadmitted it withheld from patients and doctors for years. Somestudies suggested Vioxx had caused up to 140,000 heart attacksin the U.S. alone. After a legal battle, the company in 2007 ultimatelyresolved some 27,000 lawsuits for $4.85 billion, one of thelargest settlements ever in civil litigation. In Levitt's case, the trial judge in 2007 granted Merck'smotion for judgment on the pleadings, finding her lawsuittime-barred as her injuries accrued before 2001. But the circuit judges on Monday said that in Sept. 2001,five years before Levitt filed her lawsuit, a causal theorylinking Vioxx to heart problems was only beginning to emerge. Inaddition, the majority said, Merck itself at the time waspublicly contesting the validity of the scientific claimslinking the drug to those injuries. And while there were some news articles discussing thedrug's cardiovascular risks in 2001, those were not""determinative as a matter of law,"" the panel majority said. Circuit Judge Steven Colloton in his dissent said publicinformation, including news coverage, peer-reviewed journalarticles and court records, had placed a reasonably prudentperson on notice about the links between Vioxx andcardiovascular injuries by 2000. The case is Jo Levitt v. Merck & Company Inc at the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, case no. 17-2630.

"By Simon Evans MANCHESTER, England, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane lent his support to the club's Norwegian manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after their latest disappointing result left them with a point from a 1-1 draw at home to Arsenal on Monday. United are in 10th place with just nine points, their worst start after seven games for 30 years, and they have won just one of their last six league games. But with youngsters introduced to the side this season, Irishman Keane, who won seven Premier League titles with United, believes his former team mate needs time to shape the team. ""I think he has been brilliant, a good honest guy. It is hard work at the moment, but there are six or seven young players learning their way,"" Keane said on Sky Sports. ""We’re all very impatient, we want success yesterday, but you have to give the man time. He is frustrated, under pressure, but dealing with it. He’s a classy guy but no doubt he will be disappointed at not winning enough games,"" he added. United beat Chelsea 4-0 in their opening game but their only league victory since was a 1-0 win over Leicester City. Keane said Solskjaer deserved the chance to bring in new players. ""They have given him the job. Support him in a couple of transfer windows. Are there more tough days ahead? You bet your life, but you need to stick with it,"" he said. ""There was a lack of quality from both teams tonight. Their lack of goals, the lack of opportunities they’re creating."" Solskjaer said that despite some encouraging individual displays, United's results were a concern. ""There are many things we look at and many things that give me loads of confidence,"" he said. ""We can talk about performances but it's the results that matter. You can talk about the results, I can talk about the six out of seven games good performances,"" he said.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Sydney-September 20: Fitch Ratings has assigned final ratings to the SMHL Series 2018-1 Fund's mortgage-backed pass-through floating-rate bonds, which have a five-year substitution period. The issuance consists of notes backed by a pool of first-ranking Australian residential full-documentation mortgage loans originated by Members Equity Bank Limited (ME Bank). The ratings are as follows: AUD1,700.0 million Class A notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD150.0 million Class B notes: 'NRsf' The notes are issued by Perpetual Limited in its capacity as trustee of SMHL Series 2018-1 Fund. The total collateral pool consisted of 4,205 obligors, totalling AUD1,850.0 million, at the 22 June 2018 cut-off date. KEY RATING DRIVERS Macroeconomic Factors: Fitch expects stable mortgage performance, supported by sustained economic growth in Australia. Fitch forecasts steady GDP growth of 2.7% and one 25bp cash rate increase in 2019. Asset Analysis: The transaction has a five-year substitution period, therefore, Fitch's analysis is based on a proxy pool stressed to pool parameters. The 'AAAsf' weighted-average (WA) foreclosure frequency of 13.6% is driven by the WA unindexed loan/value ratio of 74.5%, interest-only loans of 34.8% and investment loans of 34.6%. The 'AAAsf' WA loss severity of 58.9% is driven by a WA indexed scheduled loan/value ratio of 74.1% and 'AAAsf' WA market value decline of 56.8%. No credit was given to lenders' mortgage insurance. Operational Risk: ME Bank is a financial institution owned by 26 industry super funds headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria. ME Bank has been involved in the origination and management of residential mortgages since 1994. Fitch undertook an on-site operational review and found that the operations of the originator and servicer were comparable with other conforming lenders. Cash-Flow Analysis: The class A notes benefit from credit enhancement of 8.1%. Structural features include a five-year substitution period, a liquidity facility sized at 1.6% of the current asset balance with a floor of 0.16% of the initial invested amount of all notes issued and a sequential payment structure for the life of the transaction. The class A notes can withstand all relevant Fitch 'AAAsf' stresses applied in our cash-flow analysis. RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case and are likely to result in a decline in credit enhancement and remaining loss-coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased credit enhancement may make certain note ratings susceptible to negative rating action, depending on the extent of the coverage decline. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analysis of the ratings by stressing the transaction's initial base-case assumptions. Impact on note rating of increased defaults: Notes: A Rating: AAAsf Increase defaults by 15%: AAAsf Increase defaults by 30%: AAAsf Impact on note rating of decreased recoveries: Notes: A Rating: AAAsf Reduce recoveries by 15%: AAAsf Reduce recoveries by 30%: AAAsf Impact on note rating of multiple factors: Notes: A Rating: AAAsf Increase defaults by 15% and reduce recoveries by 15%: AAAsf Increase defaults by 30% and reduce recoveries by 30%: AAsf Decrease in recovery rate required to reduce note ratings: Notes: A Rating: AAAsf By one full category: 38% To non-investment grade: not even with 0% recoveries To 'CCCsf': not even with 0% recoveries USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that relate to the underlying asset pool was not prepared for this transaction because it does not involve the use of offering documents. For further information, please see Fitch's Special Report titled ""Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions,"" dated 31 May 2016. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of ME Bank's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Fitch sought to receive a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, but none was made available. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable.

"By Omar Mohammed NAIROBI, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Tanzania has formally told the World Health Organization (WHO) that it has no cases of Ebola after a woman died there earlier this month from an unknown illness following Ebola-like symptoms, the organisation said on Wednesday. ""This followed earlier rumours of the death of one person and illness in a few others,"" the WHO said in a statement. ""Tanzanian authorities did not indicate what the cause of the illnesses might have been."" The WHO received the notification on Sept. 14, the statement said. It was unclear why it took four days to make it public. The WHO announcement came a day after the head of a U.S. government health agency travelled to Tanzania at the direction of America's health secretary, Alex Azar. Azar criticized Tanzania earlier this week for not sharing information. Tanzania's health minister said on Saturday that the government had investigated two recent cases of unknown illnesses, but they were not Ebola. ""The two patients did not have Ebola,"" Ummy Mwalimu told reporters. ""There is no Ebola outbreak in Tanzania as we speak, people should not panic."" She did not say if the two cases investigated included the death of the woman. The ministry did not answer calls on Wednesday. Azar said on Monday that he was aware of a death in Tanzania and that the government had reported two suspected cases who tested negative for Ebola. ""The government of Tanzania, however, has not made available the samples or the ability to test the index case of the individual who died, nor has it made available any other information,"" Azar told reporters during a prearranged tour of Uganda, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to evaluate their Ebola response, according to a transcript of his remarks. He called on Tanzania to comply with international obligations to share information and allow independent verification of test results. There is increased vigilance across East Africa after an outbreak of Ebola in the DRC killed more than 2,000 people. It is the second-largest Ebola outbreak in global history.

"By Adela Suliman LONDON, Sept 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Wealthy foreigners are spending billions of pounds on homes near London's top private schools, even as demand for prime property in the British capital falters, new research has found. Overseas parents spent about 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) on prime property near London schools over the past year, according to a report published on Wednesday by global property firm Knight Frank. Most were from China or Russia. ""Our analysis shows just how important the standard of top London schools is to wealthy international individuals and the demand this contributes to the London property market,"" said Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank. Property prices in London have long been swelled by foreign investment, making living in the city unaffordable for those on lower incomes, although price growth has slowed since Britain voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the European Union. Anthony Breach, analyst with the British think-tank Centre for Cities, said foreign ownership was exacerbating a broader lack of affordable housing in Britain's capital. ""We need to build more housing, then more people could benefit from London's strong economy and schools,"" said Breach. ""The supply of housing is not matching the demand."" Knight Frank said political pressures coupled with an increase in taxation on high-value properties had put significant pressure on London's luxury housing market. But parents were still purchasing property in the capital while their children attend school. ""Education is the driver,"" Bailey told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""This is a sector which in terms of its appeal to a global market appears to be pretty much unaffected by Brexit ... and has remained very robust,"" he said. Prices have fallen by between 10 and 20 percent over the past three years at the top of the London market, according to Knight Frank's report. Bailey said lower property prices and a weakened pound may be attracting foreign parents to buy in London. ""Given the potential 10-year span of education for children that come over as young as 11 or 13, many of these parents are looking at a longer term commitment as opposed to a short term investment,"" he said. Knight Frank said the motivations for parents included the quality of education in Britain and the perceived boost to university and job prospects offered by attending prestigious London schools. The most popular countries to send children to school after Britain were the United States followed by Canada and other European Union countries, the report found. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has set ambitious targets to tackle a chronic housing shortage, undertaking a London-wide house building scheme of 650,000 new homes by 2029 - more than double the current rate.

"* Suppliers delay shipments to Lebanon, refuse orders * Government looks into importing wheat itself * Crisis already hit stocks months ago * Dollars more scarce during corona lockdown * Fears of shortages, more price hikes By Ellen Francis and Eric Knecht BEIRUT, April 8 (Reuters) - Lebanon's food importers, already hit by a dollar crunch, have struggled to book new cargoes as the coronavirus pandemic threatens supplies and sparks fears of even more painful price hikes. Some vendors are delaying shipments and refusing new orders to Lebanon - which relies heavily on imports - as the spread of the virus slows global food supply chains. This comes at a grim time for Lebanon. A financial crisis has wiped out about half the value of the currency and sent prices skyrocketing for months. Supply disruptions, twinned with the hard currency squeeze, risk fueling more inflation as poverty levels rise. Prices of consumer goods have nearly doubled in the past six months. Food importers like Hani Bohsali said pressure was piling on stocks, already reduced by banking controls that force buyers to get scarce dollars on an informal market. Last week, Bohsali was told Moroccan sardines were no longer available after fishermen stopped going out -- and even if they did, tins from Spain were running thin. Before that, a cooking oil shipment from Ukraine and lentils from Australia were each postponed a month because of labour shortages. ""Everything is slowing down and I fear that globally, the worst is yet to come,"" he said. FOOD SECURITY As major state buyers from Saudi Arabia to Egypt look to beef up their strategic stocks, for the first time in years Lebanon's government is thinking of importing wheat itself, a job usually left to private mills. Economy Minister Raoul Nehme told Reuters the cabinet had authorized importing 80,000 tonnes though this was not ""in the works today"". ""It is just a measure to be ready at any point in case we need it, for food security...to have an additional security stock."" The government has warned that foreign currency reserves plummeted to ""dangerous"" levels, pledging to keep them for key goods: wheat, fuel and medicine. Buyers of staples like grains worry other countries will hold back shipments as the pandemic drags on or choose not to prioritise the small nation of around six million. ""The interruptions because of the lack of cash dollars, the lockdowns abroad, we're going to see the impact in two months,"" said Nabil Fahed, an importer who heads the supermarket syndicate. ""The supplies will not be there...I'm really worried about this"". 'NOBODY SELLING' With a tiny industrial sector and scant natural resources, Lebanon's economy produces few goods. Fahed, who owns a major supermarket chain, said prices for most goods have risen 45-50%, with some already running out. Any harsher shortages could still be a few months off. Importers put stocks of most goods at 1-2 months and supermarkets remain largely full despite some panic shopping during Lebanon's shutdown. ""I work on wheat, flour, rice and sugar, and nobody is selling anything,"" said Paul Mansour, owner of Crown Mills. ""Whatever is already booked, there's a delay. For any new business, there's nothing in the market."" ""This will drag on and get very bad,"" he said. ""If goods are delayed beyond a month, there's going to be a serious issue of stocks.""

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Austin-November 07: Fitch Ratings has downgraded the following Hitchcock Independent School District, TX (the district) ratings to 'A+' from 'AA-': --$31.6 million general obligation unlimited tax bonds; --Issuer Default Rating (IDR). The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The bonds are payable from an unlimited property tax levy and are further backed by the PSF bond guaranty program, which Fitch rates 'AAA.' ANALYTICAL CONCLUSION The downgrade of the IDR and GO ratings to 'A+' from 'AA-' reflects the district's weakening operating profile after several years of drawdowns on reserves. The weakened reserves leave the district's financial flexibility more vulnerable to a recessionary decline in revenues. The district's 'A+' rating is supported by a sound level of expenditure flexibility and strong revenue growth prospects. Fitch expects the district's long-term liability burden to grow over time, mainly driven by a significant amount of capital appreciation bonds that have not yet fully accreted and borrowing by overlapping entities. Economic Resource Base The district is located in Galveston County in southeast Texas, adjacent to Texas City and 10 miles northwest of the city of Galveston. The district serves a 2017 population of about 10,000, with enrollment of approximately 1,700 students. The district's population growth of 13.9% since 2010 has outpaced the state's 12.6%. District resident income and employment metrics generally lag county, state, and national figures. The local economy is centered on petrochemicals, port activities, tourism and the University of Texas Medical Branch. KEY RATING DRIVERS Revenue Framework: 'a' A combination of local property taxes and state aid supports district operations. Fitch expects strong revenue growth in future years, based on historical performance and continued enrollment growth trends. The district's legal ability to raise revenues is limited. Expenditure Framework: 'aa' The natural pace of spending growth is expected to remain in line with or marginally above that of revenues, given manageable capital needs and current enrollment trends. The district's moderate carrying costs reflect state support for debt service and retiree benefits, bolstering spending flexibility. Long-Term Liability Burden: 'a' Fitch expects the long-term liability burden to grow but remain in the moderate-to-elevated range, given substantial borrowing authorization by overlapping entities and the accretion of the district's capital appreciation bonds. Retiree benefit obligations do not represent a significant burden due to significant state support. Operating Performance: 'aa' The 'aa' operating performance assessment reflects Fitch's expectations that the district would manage through a moderate economic downturn while maintaining an adequate level of fundamental financial flexibility. RATING SENSITIVITIES Maintenance of Financial Flexibility: The rating is sensitive to material changes in the district's very strong gap-closing capacity, including solid expenditure flexibility. Fitch's assessment of financial resilience assumes Hitchcock ISD will gradually increase reserve levels to meet growing spending going forward. CREDIT PROFILE Enrollment has grown at a strong pace over the last 10 years despite declines following the destruction caused by Hurricane Ike in September 2008 and Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. The area functions as a bedroom community to Galveston and Houston, and taxable assessed value (TAV) growth has continued even following Hurricane Harvey. Any negative impact to local oil service companies from persistently lower oil prices likely would be offset by lower energy costs to the large petrochemical facilities in the area. Other top taxpayers include real estate, energy, retail, telecom, and rail concerns. Revenue Framework Funding for public schools in Texas is provided by a combination of local (property tax), state and federal resources. The state budgets the majority of instructional activity through the Foundation School Program (FSP), which uses a statutory formula to allocate school aid taking into account each district's property taxes, projected enrollment, and amounts appropriated by the legislature in the biennial budget process. The Tier 1 component of the FSP provides districts a certain level of operational funding, and the basis for most Tier 1 allotments is called the basic allotment. The basic allotment is a per pupil dollar amount that multiplied by average daily attendance (and adjusted for specific circumstances) produces a district's Tier 1 allotment. Approximately half of the district's revenues come from the state, with the remainder generated by property tax revenues. The district's enrollment has grown at a strong 4.3% CAGR over the last decade. The district reports that fiscal 2019 enrollment surpassed the pre-Hurricane Harvey level. Enrollment trends drive revenue performance, as any variations in property tax revenues due to TAV performance will be offset by state aid adjustments. District revenues grew at a CAGR of 3.8% during the decade ending fiscal year 2018, performing slightly above national GDP. Fitch expects the natural pace of district revenue growth in future years to be in line with to above U.S. economic performance given solid enrollment growth trends and planned residential developments coming online. Fitch's assessment of the district's growth prospects for revenues also incorporates the passage of House Bill 3 (HB3). For the state's fiscal 2020-2021 biennium, the state is increasing Texas Education Agency (TEA) funding by roughly 20% through the provisions of HB3, which was approved by the 2019 Texas legislature and signed into law by the governor. In addition, HB3 calls for the compression of local operating tax rates and requires districts to limit annual operating tax revenue increases to 2.5% (by requiring a reduction in the M&O rate if TAV increases by more than 2.5%). The increased funding is driven primarily by an increase in the per student basic allotment to $6,160 from $5,140. HB3 requires districts to apply 30% of annual increased funding to full-time employee compensation increases (75% of which would go to teachers, counselors, nurses, and librarians). The tax rate compression is designed to be offset by the increase in state revenues. The district does not have the ability to independently raise revenues. The district's current M&O tax rate of $1.04 per $100 of TAV in fiscal 2019, recently compressed to $0.97 due to the HB3 mandate, is at the legal limit. The law will allow districts to raise the M&O by once cent in fiscal 2021 without voter approval. Any increase up to the maximum of $1.068 would require voter authorization. This limitation as a factor in the revenue framework assessment is somewhat offset by the recognition of K-12 education as fundamentally a state responsibility and the strong foundation of state support for education funding. The district levies a separate unlimited tax rate for debt service that stood at $0.41 per $100 of TAV in fiscal 2020, which is $0.09 below the state enforced debt service rate cap of $0.50 for new money bond issuance. Expenditure Framework The district spends 50% of its operating budget on instruction. The district also funds some annual capital outlay from general fund revenues for maintenance and repairs on facilities. Fitch expects the natural pace of spending growth to remain in line with to marginally above that of revenues absent policy action, given salary pressure and modest capital needs. The district's solid expenditure flexibility reflects strong control over workforce costs and moderate carrying costs for debt service, pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB) at 13% of fiscal 2018 governmental spending. Carrying costs benefit from state-wide support for school district pension and OPEB contributions. The district participates in the Texas Teachers Retirement System (TRS), a cost-sharing multiple employer pension system. Senate Bill 12 (SB12), which was approved by the 2019 Texas legislature and signed into law by the governor, will direct the allocation of $1.1 billion in state funding to contribute to TRS over the next several years. Roughly $600 million from this allocation will be used to finance a one-time payment of $2,000 to retired teachers; the remainder will be used to gradually increase state contributions to TRS. Over the next six years, educators, school districts, and the state will incrementally ramp up their respective contributions. Districts and employees will begin to increase their contributions in fiscal 2021; by fiscal 2024 teachers will pay 8.25% of salary (up from 7.7% currently), with districts increasing their contributions (currently 1.5% of payroll) by 0.1% annually until reaching 2% in fiscal 2025. Between fiscal years 2020 and 2024, the state will steadily increase its contribution of total employee payroll to 8.25% from the current 7.5%. These changes combined with a reduction in the discount rate to 7.25% from 8% will allow for a pension amortization period of less than 31 years, consistent with the current 32 years. Fitch has consistently considered the risk that the state could increase district contributions to TRS in its assessment of each entity's expenditure framework and believes most districts can accommodate the increases mandated by SB12 without compromising spending flexibility. Long-Term Liability Burden The combined burden of long-term debt and pension liabilities is moderate-to-elevated relative to resident personal income at about 21%. Direct debt accounts for 41% of the long-term liability burden, while overlapping debt amounts to 47% and Fitch-adjusted net pension liability just over 12% of the burden. Overlapping entities retain substantial debt authorization which could push the burden higher. The district recently released a request for proposals for a study to determine its capital needs in the next few years. The results of this study and continued enrollment growth could result in in further bond issuance. Under GASB 67 and 68, TRS' assets covered 82.2% of liabilities as of fiscal 2018, a ratio that falls to 65% using a more conservative 6% return assumption. The state assumes the majority of TRS employer contributions and net pension liability on behalf of school districts, except for small amounts that state statute requires districts to assume. The district's pension contributions are determined by state statute rather than actuarially, and they have historically fallen short of the actuarial level. Recent state reforms have lowered benefits and increased statutory contributions to improve plan sustainability over time. The TRS board at its July 2018 meeting voted to lower the discount rate for the TRS pension plan to 7.25% from 8%. This move increases the plan's current $35.5 billion net pension liability (NPL) by $10 billion. As noted above, contributions by the state, districts and employees will be increasing over the next six years to help address the increased NPL without increasing the amortization period. This change in the discount rate and overall increase in the NPL does not affect Fitch's analysis of the long-term liability burden, as Fitch currently utilizes a lower 6% return assumption when considering the burden. Operating Performance Despite a decline in general fund reserves as a percentage of spending out to 17.2% in fiscal 2018 from a peak of 34.2% in fiscal 2013, the district exhibits strong gap-closing capacity. Fitch's assessment of financial resilience considers reserves relative to the district's midrange inherent budget flexibility and somewhat elevated revenue volatility. The Fitch Analytical Sensitivity Tool (FAST) produces a single-year 3.6% revenue decline in a standard 1% U.S. GDP decline scenario. The reduction in reserves coupled with the district's sensitivity to economic downturns leaves the district more vulnerable to moderate recessions despite its midrange inherent budget flexibility. Fitch expects that the increased revenues related to HB3 will allow the district to gradually increase reserves, maintaining an adequate level of financial resilience in downturns and very strong gap closing capacity. The use of reserves to support operations during the economic recovery and expansion over the last several years, notwithstanding the one-year drop in enrollment and revenue due to Hurricane Harvey, weighs on Fitch's assessment of the district's budget management. The district projects a modest increase to fund balance in fiscal 2019, and plans for another modest increase in fiscal 2020 despite the large jump in per-student revenues from HB3.

"(Adds details, quotes, background) By Darya Korsunskaya and Polina Nikolskaya MOSCOW, March 19 (Reuters) - Russian statistics serviceRosstat plans to stop publishing data on real disposable incomeevery month and will give figures once a quarter which itbelieves will be more accurate, Rosstat head Pavel Malkov saidon Tuesday. Steady growth in real disposable income was part of VladimirPutin's presidential decree after his fourth inauguration in Maylast year. Yet Russians' real disposable income has been falling since2014 when Western countries first imposed sanctions on Russiaafter the country seized Crimea from Ukraine. Real income in Russia fell 0.2 percent year-on-year in 2018once payments to pensioners, which replaced indexing of pensionsto inflation in 2017, are accounted for. Malkov told reporters the service was planning to change themethodology it uses to calculate real disposable income. ""There have been a lot of questions regarding themethodology. We need to radically restructure the way we work,""he said. In particular, Rosstat plans to adjust data on wages, incomefrom business activity and spending in a number of areas, almostdoubling the sourcing data it uses. Critics expressed concern that publishing real incomes dataonce a quarter could give Rosstat room for manoeuvre to reportbetter data. Rosstat is due to publish its monthly economic indicators,including real disposable income, on Wednesday. As Putin made increasing the wealth of ordinary Russianfamilies his priority last year, authorities have activelystarted to discuss making income disclosures less frequent, on aquarterly basis or once a year, three high-ranked officials toldReuters. ""We wanted to close the income data to the public threeyears ago. This is an absolutely meaningless indicator, it doesnot reflect anything at all,"" a source in one of the ministriessaid. A Kremlin source said the calculation of real disposableincome was tricky because Rosstat does not properly take intoaccount Internet commerce data, so there are issues withcitizens' savings data due to the volatility of the rouble. Rosstat said it planned to change the methodology onInternet commerce and savings data, in particular on depositsheld by Russians in foreign exchange. A poll by the independent Moscow-based Levada Centre showedin December that more than half of Russians wanted thegovernment to resign. Most respondents said officials wereunable to curb rising prices and falling incomes. Russia's economic growth climbed to a six-year high of 2.3percent in 2018, yet officials later said it was fuelled byone-off factors and could be revised lower.

CORONAVIRUS President Tayyip Erdogan advised Turks on Wednesday not to leave home unless necessary for three weeks and to minimise social contact until the threat of the coronavirus recedes, but he did not tell them to stay away from work. Turkey subsequently announced a second coronavirus death and said the number of confirmed cases of the highly contagious respiratory illness had nearly doubled to 191 after it ramped up steps to combat the virus' spread, closing cafes, banning mass prayers and halting flights to 20 countries. ECONOMIC PACKAGE Erdogan also said Turkey would postpone debt payments and reduce tax burdens in various sectors under a 100 billion lira ($15.4 billion) package to support the economy and lessen the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. CLOTHING RETAILERS SHUT SHOPS Turkish clothing retailers, including Mavi Giyim and Vakko Tekstil, are temporarily shutting stores in response to the spread of a coronavirus, they said.

"By Marc Frank HAVANA, July 30 (Reuters) - Communist-run Cuba on Tuesdayimposed sweeping price controls on all state and privatebusinesses as it battles a deepening economic crisis andmounting U.S. sanctions. Resolutions published in the official gazette banned allretail and wholesale price increases except for productsimported and distributed by the state where already-set profitmargins cannot be increased. ""In effect they have suspended what there is of a market,"" aCuban economist said, asking not to be identified due torestrictions on talking to foreign journalists. While state-run companies dominate the economy, reforms inrecent years have led to a growing private sector ofcooperatives, farmers, small businesses and self-employedindividuals who, for example, work in the skilled trades ordrive taxis, and in general operate on a market basis. Resolution 302 of the Finances and Prices Ministry lists allactors in what is called the non-state sector, saying that they""cannot increase current prices and tariffs of products andservices."" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel announced earlier thismonth that the government had adopted a series of emergencymeasures to fight economic stagnation and dwindling foreigncurrency earnings that began in 2015 as the economy of key allyVenezuela imploded, and which have been aggravated by a seriesof new U.S. sanctions. The measures included increased wages and pensions for morethan 2 million state employees, amounting to more than 8 billionpesos annually, or close to 13 percent of this year’s budget. Diaz-Canel said other measures still to be announcedincluded price controls and policies aimed at stimulating localproduction to meet increased consumer demand without sparkinginflation. Cafeteria owner Manuel Rodriguez, like other small businessowners, said he had no problem with the controls if the stateand informal sector complied, which he doubted. ""I agree and would comply with regulating prices, butdomestic products are scarce in stores and we must resort toimported ones that are more expensive,"" Rodriguez said. Economist Andrew Zimbalist, a Cuba expert at Smith Collegein the United States, said, ""Such measures are usually okay forshort periods of time, but if they stay in place they begin tocreate serious distortions in the economy."" Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist whoteaches at Colombia’s Universidad Javeriana Cali, took a similarview. ""The more they control prices in formal markets, the moreinflation and instability there will be in informal markets andthe less incentive the productive sector has,"" he said.(Reporting by Marc Frank; additional reporting by Nelson AcostaEditing by Leslie Adler)","Cuba, battling economic crisis, imposes sweeping price controls"," communist-run cuba on t tuesdayimposed sweeping price controls on all state and private businesses. the move comes as the country battles a deepening economic crisis andmounting u.s . sanctions. while state-run companies dominate the economy, reforms have led to a growing private sector.","cuba imposes price controls on all state , private businesses in economic crisis"

The slide in oil prices ""is delivering a very, very hard blow to the Canadian dollar,"" said Karl Schamotta, director global markets strategy at Cambridge Global Payments. ""The correlation between WTI (West Texas Intermediate) and the Canadian dollar has risen quite substantially.""     The one-month rolling correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil rose to 85 percent on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, indicating that the currency and the commodity move mostly in the same direction. As recently as August, the correlation was negative.     At 3:35 p.m. (2035 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3249 to the greenback, or 75.48 U.S. cents. Still, the currency touched 1.3264, its weakest intraday level since July 20.     The U.S. dollar        declined against a basket of major currencies as Britain and the European Union agreed on a preliminary text for the nation to leave the economic bloc, boosting the euro and sterling.                  ""Optimism surrounding a Brexit deal has had virtually no impact on the Canadian dollar,"" Schamotta said.     Wall Street gave up early gains as a rebound in technology stocks and renewed hope for progress in trade talks were offset by drops in Boeing and energy stocks.                  Canadian government bond prices were higher across a flatter yield curve, tracking U.S. Treasuries, following the Remembrance Day holiday in Canada on Monday.     The two-year            rose 6 Canadian cents to yield 2.307 percent and the 10-year             climbed 43.5 Canadian cents to yield 2.455 percent.

"* JGB yields rise as market expects BOJ to loosen its grip * BOJ conducts special bond buying operation at 0.10 pct * BOJ buys record 1.64 trln yen in special operation * 20-year yield hits 6-month high of 0.600 pct By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, July 30 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices sagged on Monday, with the benchmark 10-year yield touching its highest level in almost a year and a half, as the market tries to test the Bank of Japan's intention ahead of its policy decision the next day. That forced the BOJ to conduct a special bond buying operation for two sessions in a row and to end up buying a record amount in that type of purchase to stem rising bond yields amid growing expectations the BOJ could adjust its policy. While there is no clear consensus, some market players think the BOJ could possibly announce it would allow larger moves in the JGB market by loosening its interpretation of its policy target of ""around zero percent"" in the 10-year yield. Since the BOJ began the current policy in September 2016, the market has taken that to mean less than 0.100 percent as the BOJ has intervened to stem a rise in the yields, by conducting unlimited buying at 0.110 percent. On Friday the BOJ lowered the yield to 0.100 percent. Still the 10-year JGB yield rose to as high as 0.110 percent earlier on Monday, in defiance of the BOJ's apparent defence line. The BOJ offered to buy 10-year JGBs at the yield of 0.100 percent again on Monday, its third such purchase in just over a week. As investors rushed to sell before possible policy tweaks, the BOJ bought a record 1.64 trillion yen ($14.76 billion) of JGBs in Monday's operation, surpassing the previous record of 724 billion yen in February last year. ""We think the BOJ will allow wider trading band for the 10-year JGBs while sticking to its official policy guidance of zero percent in the 10-year yield,"" said Naomi Muguruma, senior strategist at MUFG Securities. The BOJ is expected to announce its policy some time around noon (0300 GMT) and 2 p.m. (0500 GMT) local time. The price of 10-year JGB futures fell 0.13 point to 150.44 . The 20-year JGB yield rose to 1.5 basis point to a six-month high of 0.600 percent. The 30-year yield rose 1.5 basis point to six-month high of 0.825 percent. At the short end of the yield curve, the five-year yield rose 0.5 basis point to minus 0.090 percent and the two-year yield gained 0.5 basis point to minus 0.115 percent.

"(Adds Workers Party statement) By Ricardo Brito and Anthony Boadle BRASILIA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Brazil's top electoral court on Friday barred jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from running in this year's presidential because of his corruption conviction. The widely expected decision removes a cloud hanging over Brazil's most uncertain election in decades - though Lula's lawyers have said they would appeal an adverse decision to the Supreme Court. ""What is at stake here today is the equality of all citizens before the law and the Constitution,"" Judge Og Fernandes told the court in his vote to declare Lula ineligible. Judge Admar Gonzaga, who as a lawyer worked for Lula's handpicked successor Dilma Rousseff's 2010 election, cast the decisive vote in the 6-1 decision that sealed the leftist icon's ejection from the presidential election. Lula, Brazil's most popular politician, is serving a 12-year sentence for a corruption conviction. His Workers Party registered him as its presidential candidate for the Oct. 7 vote anyway, saying he is innocent. Lula is ineligible for office under Brazil's ""Clean Slate"" law, which prohibits candidates from running if they have convictions that have been upheld on appeal. Despite his conviction and several graft cases pending against him, Lula leads the race by a long stretch, with 39 percent of voter support, according to pollster Datafolha. His nearest rival, far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, has 19 percent. Ads by the Workers Party calling on Brazilians to vote for Lula began to appear on social media on Friday, and will be shown on television as of Saturday when the race enters its final 35 days of campaigning. A party statement said the court had bowed to the wishes of Brazil's elites to stop Lula returning to office. The court had also ignored a recommendation by the United Nations Human Rights Committee to restore Lula's political rights which he appeals his conviction, it said. Vice-presidential running mate Fernando Haddad, a former mayor of Sao Paulo, is expected to head the ticket hoping to inherit the bulk of Lula's votes. The party has until Sept. 17 to swap their names on the ballot, though the court gave it 10 days to make the change. The court also ruled that Lula should not appear in the Workers Party's television and radio ads campaign until the ticket has been officially altered to remove him. The court on Thursday had rejected another request by opponents of Lula to exclude his name from opinion polls.

"(Updates to add details from the indictment) By Maayan Lubell JERUSALEM, NOV 23, (Reuters) - Secret recordings, powerful media moguls, illicit gifts of cigars and champagne, betrayals by trusted aides. The three corruption cases against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have all the makings of a political thriller. On Thursday, after more than three years of investigations, the most dominant Israeli politician of his generation was charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Investigators have not revealed the informants who provided the first tips about alleged corruption by the veteran conservative nicknamed ""King Bibi."" But from there they methodically picked off members of the prime minister's inner circle of hand-picked aides and senior officials as state witnesses against him. The mounting evidence was revealed in a series of tantalizing leaks that undercut what prosecutors allege was Netanyahu's scheme to control his public image by trading regulatory favors to news companies for positive coverage. The man who charged the prime minister was Israel’s Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit - who was chosen for the job by Netanyahu in 2016 after having served as his cabinet secretary starting in 2013. ""I had the privilege of working with him and witnessing his many talents and capabilities as prime minister,"" Mandelblit said in announcing the charges. ""The decision to file an indictment against him was made with a heavy heart."" Netanyahu has denied wrongdoing from the beginning of the investigations and remained defiant in his emotional prime-time national address on the night of his indictment. He called the cases an “attempted coup” to overthrow him, based on “fabrications.” 'ROTTEN' The probe began with tips trickling into investigators. ""Something smelled rotten, but it wasn't clearly criminal,"" a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation told Reuters. Mandelblit launched an initial inquiry in July 2016, soon after Netanyahu chose him as attorney general. Investigators soon focused on dealings between the prime minister, Israeli Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. The inquiries would eventually lead to Case 1000, in which Netanyahu is charged with fraud and breach of trust for allegedly requesting and receiving gifts from Packer and Milchan, which included a regular supply of cigars and champagne. The indictment alleges Netanyahu helped Milchan with various business interests. Milchan and Packer provided testimony and have not been charged with any wrongdoing. During a separate probe of Netanyahu's former chief of staff, Ari Harow, investigators stumbled on a Pandora's box: secret recordings made on Harow's mobile phone. They documented a series of meetings between two men who were then known publicly as enemies: Netanyahu and Arnon Mozes, the owner of Israel's best-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, and the popular news website Ynet. ""It was jaw-dropping,"" said the source, describing the moment investigators first heard the recordings. In meetings held between 2008 and 2014, the two allegedly discussed a deal in which Mozes would provide positive coverage of Netanyahu and negative coverage of his political rivals, while Netanyahu would push for regulations on Yedioth's biggest competitor, Israel Hayom, a free daily owned by U.S. casino mogul and Netanyahu supporter, Sheldon Adelson. The 63-page indictment released on Thursday quotes a meeting held in December 2014 during the run-up to the 2015 election. Prosecutors allege the two men discussed a bill that would have limited Israel Hayom's circulation. ""We need to make sure you are prime minister,"" Mozes allegedly told Netanyahu. ""Assuming there will be a law that you and I have agreed upon, I will do my utmost best that you stick around for as long as you want to."" The bill the two men discussed would never become law, and the coverage of Netanyahu in Yedioth and Ynet did not substantially change. The recordings shocked prosecutors as they digested them over six hours, the source told Reuters. ""That was a big drama,"" said the source. ""It's hard to believe something like this can even happen."" The recordings set off the investigation that led to Case 2000, which charges Netanyahu with fraud and breach of trust and Mozes with bribery. Harow served two stints as Netanyahu’s chief of staff before resigning in 2015 amid allegations that he improperly advanced his own business interests while holding the position. Harow turned state’s witness against Netanyahu in 2017 as part of a plea deal in which he confessed to fraud and breach of trust. Mozes's lawyers denied wrongdoing in a written statement and called prosecutors allegations of bribery an ""erroneous and warped interpretation"" of the recordings. 'THEY WERE AFTER ME' The most serious case against Netanyahu, Case 4000, did not start with the prime minister. In 2017, Israel's Securities Authority (ISA) was investigating Shaul Elovitch, the chairman of the country’s biggest telecommunications firm, Bezeq Israel Telecom. ISA was investigating whether he had illegally profited from a 2015 deal in which Bezeq bought out his remaining shares in a satellite TV company. Netanyahu, who at the time also served as Communications Minister, was not a suspect. One of the key figures in the probe - Shlomo Filber, then director-general of the communications ministry - was picked for the government job by Netanyahu soon after he took over the communications ministry. The investigation revealed a secret backchannel between Bezeq and Filber, according to the indictment. Investigators later found evidence pointing to the prime minister's involvement in regulatory moves that prosecutors allege provided a benefit worth about 1.8 billion Shekels ($500 million) to Bezeq. The company has denied wrongdoing. In 2018, Filber turned state witness against Netanyahu. Case 4000 alleges that Netanyahu's regulatory favors for Elovitch were part of a wider ""give and take"" relationship. Bezeq controlled a popular news website called Walla. The indictment alleges that Netanyahu made a series of regulatory concessions that benefited Elovitch in return for better coverage of him and his family on the website. It describes a dinner in which Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, hosted Elovitch and his wife, Iris, a few weeks before Israel's 2013 election. ""The defendants agreed that Netanyahu and his wife will be able to make demands on Mr. and Mrs. Elovitch concerning their media coverage,"" the indictment said. The Netanyahus allegedly made hundreds of demands over the next few years for Walla to change headlines, remove negative reports about them and increase exposure of positive ones. The Elovitches have been charged with bribery and obstruction of justice. Shaul Elovitch has also been charged with money laundering. The couple denies any wrongdoing. The indictment cited a striking example of Netanyahu’s influence on the news involving a rare interview he gave Walla, days before a 2015 election. ""Netanyahu was very angry about the questions,"" Dov Gilhar, the journalist who interviewed him, told Israel's public broadcaster Kan in March. After the interview, ""Netanyahu ripped the neck-mic off, threw it on the floor, says nothing, gets up, walks into his office and slams the door."" Gilhar told Kan that he had expected the exclusive interview to be published quickly, but two days passed before a chopped-down version ran after being edited without the journalist's involvement. The indictment alleges the edits were dictated by Netanyahu and Nir Hefetz, the media advisor to the prime minister's family at the time and his former official spokesman. Hefetz turned state witness in 2018. Netanyahu has been charged with bribery in this case, as well as fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu's demands on Walla ceased around January 2017, the indictment said, when the prime minister and Elovitch became concerned about an investigation into their dealings and Walla stopped complying with requests to favor Netanyahu in its coverage. Walla's news desk did not respond to a request for comment. Netanyahu said on Thursday that quid pro quo relations between politicians and the media were common, but he was being singled out. ""They weren't after the truth,"" Netanyahu said of police and prosecutors. ""They were after me."" Attorney General Mandelblit has rejected Netanyahu's accusations. A source close to Mandelblit described him as ""very fond of Netanyahu."" ""But at the end of the day, there's no room for sentiment,"" the source said. ""Either the evidence tells the story or it doesn't.""

"By Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers LONDON, March 26 (Reuters) - Several of Britain's digital banks are still waiting to hear if they can offer government-backed loans to struggling small businesses damaged by the coronavirus outbreak, days after a multi-billion pound rescue scheme was launched. Neo-banks including OakNorth, Tide and Starling - which have hundreds of thousands of business customers between them - have applied to take part in the so-called Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) but have not heard when they will be able to access the funds to help customers in need. The scheme was first unveiled by UK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak last week as part of a 330 billion pound support package for firms hit by a sudden surge in costs from staff falling ill or self-isolating, and a simultaneous collapse in revenues triggered by the country's lockdown. The government-backed British Business Bank (BBB) launched CBILS on Monday by repurposing an existing funding scheme set up during the global financial crisis in early 2009 and backed by more than 40 accredited lenders, including the bulk of Britain's traditional high street banks. But digital banks who were not signed up to the earlier scheme have so far been unable to offer the relief funding to their customers, and remain subject to an accreditation process before they can participate. ""It's important new lenders are on-boarded quickly to deal with the demand. Tide is still yet to receive a response to our registration of interest,"" Chief Executive Oliver Prill said. ""There is a concern that the BBB is very stretched and so we urgently call on the government to ensure that it is adequately resourced and that management is setting the right priorities."" The CBILS was initially expected to be worth 1.2 billion pounds but the government has since said it will be demand-led. OakNorth Bank, which was launched in 2015 and counts restaurant chains Leon and Brasserie Blanc and leisure groups Z Hotels and Nine Group Hotels among its clients, said the government needed to act fast to prevent small firms from failing. A spokesman for the BBB declined to comment on how many applications it had received from unaccredited lenders and how long they would take to process. ""The number one priority was to get it up and running. Now that we have done that, our priority is to get more lenders signed up. We have allocated extra resources to processing applications,"" he said. A spokeswoman for Starling, founded in 2014, said: ""We understand why they have set the scheme up in this way. The important thing is getting money into the hands of businesses as soon as they can.""

The Bank of Japan is expected to keep its targets forshort-term interest rates and its long-term government bondyield unchanged next week, according to the poll. Consumer prices, another key gauge for market watchers onpolicy, likely edged down in May, putting pressure on the BOJ asit remains far from achieving its elusive 2% inflation target. ""Exports likely dropped as factories halted during the10-day national holidays and external demand is weakening,"" saidKoya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities,referring to the Golden Week holiday that was extended this yearto mark the enthronement of a new emperor. ""We need to see how exports data for June fared to examineits trend but the intensified U.S.-China trade war will havemore of an effect on trade in June."" Exports in May are forecast to have dropped 7.7% from a yearearlier, according to the poll of 16 economists, compared with a2.4% contraction in April and the biggest drop since January. May imports are seen up 0.2% from a year earlier after arevised 6.5% gain in April, resulting in a trade deficit of979.2 billion yen ($9.04 billion), the poll showed.

The poll also projected Japan's core consumer price index,which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh foodcosts, would rise 0.8% in May from year earlier, down from a0.9% gain in April. ""Prices of electricity and gas, which reflected falls in oilprices, likely contributed to lower prices,"" said TakumiTsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank ResearchInstitute.

"(Adds quotes) BIRMINGHAM, England, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Britain's environment minister, Michael Gove, one of the ruling Conservative Party's highest-profile Brexit campaigners, threw his weight on Sunday behind Prime Minister Theresa May's strategy to leave the European Union, dismissing a rival proposal by his former ally Boris Johnson. On the first day of the governing Conservatives' annual conference the divisions over the EU that have hampered the party for decades were on show - with Johnson, who quit as foreign secretary in July over May's Brexit plan, attacking her proposal as ""deranged"". But Gove, who teamed up with Johnson during their Brexit campaign only to pull his support for Johnson's leadership bid in 2016, said he was fully behind May and her so-called ""Chequers"" plan, named for the country house where it was agreed by the cabinet in July. Johnson has denounced the Chequers proposal and called instead for a plan based on an EU-Canada free trade pact, which he referred to as ""super Canada"". Gove told an event organised by environmental pressure group Greener UK: ""I'm in favour of a 'super Britain' deal. The prime minister has put forward a proposal, which I support."" Gove also sought to ease concern that Britain would lower its food or environmental standards after Brexit to win a free trade agreement with the United States. ""The prime minister has been clear that we would not lower social or environmental protections, and I think rightly that is where the public are,"" he said. ""I think there is a particular strength for the UK in being known as the home of quality food."" Gove acknowledged that he was concerned about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU in March without first securing an agreement, but said he hoped both sides would try to minimise the fall-out from such an event. ""I do worry about it and I think a deal would be much, much better and I think if we left without a deal I think the UK and the EU would put in place all sorts of arrangements in order to make sure that he impact was mitigated,"" he said.

"By Brent Lang LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro has been accused of gender discrimination and fostering an abusive working environment for women in a $12 million lawsuit filed by an ex-employee, Graham Chase Robinson. Among other things, De Niro purportedly used sexist language, calling female employees ""c--s"" and ""bitches,"" and referred to Robinson, who was his executive assistant, as his ""office wife."" ""Robert De Niro is someone who has clung to old mores,"" the lawsuit reads. ""He does not accept the idea that men should treat women as equals. He does not care that gender discrimination in the workplace violates the law. Ms. Robinson is a casualty of this attitude."" De Niro's company filed a $6 million suit against Robinson in August, accusing her of embezzling money and binge-watching Netflix while on the job. That suit went viral with its claim that Robinson spent a four-day period in January watching 55 episodes of ""Friends."" The latest round of explosive claims hit as De Niro is appearing in two major film releases -- ""Joker,"" a comic-book adaptation that opens on Friday, and ""The Irishman,"" a gangster epic that is considered to be an Oscar frontrunner. De Niro's company, Canal Productions, is also named in the lawsuit. In her suit, Robinson says she was underpaid compared to male colleagues and given ""female duties like housework."" De Niro allegedly joked to Robinson about his Viagra prescription, asked her to imagine him on the toilet and suggested she could get pregnant using sperm from a married male co-worker. Robinson goes on to say that in April, she submitted her resignation and had her attorney tell De Niro's team that she was contemplating a lawsuit that would address De Niro's gender discrimination and wage violations. ""In response, De Niro took a page out of the Bill O'Reilly playbook,"" the suit reads. ""Before Ms. Robinson could sue, De Niro retaliated."" Robinson says her former employee's lawsuit was ""replete with 'clickbait' allegations that falsely characterize Ms. Robinson as a loafer, a thief and a miscreant. Now, when her name is Googled, these allegations pop up on the screen. The results have been devastating to Ms. Robinson. Her reputation and her career have been destroyed."" De Niro's suit accused Robinson of charging thousands of dollars of personal expenses, including travel and meals at high-end restaurants, on the company credit card. The suit also claimed that Robinson had misappropriated $125,000 worth of frequent flyer miles. According to the suit, she was making $300,000 a year at the time she left the company. Robinson's suit denies those claims, and says De Niro had personally approved the disputed transactions. Robinson also denies that she ""loafed"" or ""binge-watched"" during work hours.

"By Dena Aubin (Reuters) - The United States government does not have to help PPG Industries pay for cleanup costs at a shuttered plant in New Jersey used to produce chromium chemicals for the defense effort during World Wars I and II, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled. In a decision on Monday, U.S. District Judge John Vazquez in Newark rejected PPG's argument that the federal government took control of all aspects of the Jersey City plant during the wars and is thus partially liable for cleaning up chromium contamination there. Although the government controlled the price of raw materials and finished chromium products and conferred with chemical companies about production alternatives, it did not control day-to-day operations at the site, Vazquez said. A PPG spokesman said the company is aware of the decision and evaluating its legal options. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice, which defended the lawsuit, could not immediately be reached. Built in 1915 by Natural Products Refinery Corporation (NPR), the plant produced chromium chemicals that were used to make gas masks, body armor, shells and other materials for the government's war effort. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co, which later changed its name to PPG, bought the plant in 1954 and operated it until it was shut down in 1963, according to court filings. PPG was notified of contamination at the plant by Jersey City in 1982. After extensive testing, PPG agreed to clean up the site under a settlement with New Jersey in 1990. It reached another settlement in 2009 with the state and Jersey City calling for continued cleanup. PPG had spent $361 million on cleanup activities by year-end 2015, according to court filings. PPG sued the federal government in 2012, seeking reimbursement from the federal government for cleanup costs under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Under CERCLA, companies that pay for an environmental cleanup can recover costs from owners or operators of a polluting facility or persons who arranged for disposal of wastes. PPG said the government was responsible for wastes generated during both wars, when it controlled the plant's supply of raw materials, production, labor force and hazardous waste disposal. The government required NPR to produce specific amounts of chromium chemicals and thus controlled the amounts of hazardous waste generated, the lawsuit said. The U.S. government moved for a judgment in its favor in February this year, saying PPG produced no evidence that the government controlled site operations or had anything to do with the waste generated. PPG's claims largely rely on the government's wartime regulation of the national economy, but those general regulatory powers are not evidence that it controlled waste activities at the site, the government said. In Monday's opinion, Vazquez agreed that the government never took over the plant's operations. The government controlled the price of NPR's raw materials and finished products, participated in one of NPR's labor disputes and engaged in discussions with NPR about how to increase production, but it never directly managed or conducted NPR's operations, Vazquez said. The case is PPG Industries v. United States, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 12-3526.

Germany has 9,973 megawatts (MW) of nuclear generation capacity provided by seven reactors,operated by three companies.    Previously in 2011, Germany had taken the axe to the bulk of its nuclear capacity, switchingoff the seven oldest blocks plus Vattenfall's Kruemmel permanently after the Japan nuclearcrisis earlier that year raised safety concerns. It also sped up the timetable for closure ofall remaining capacity by 2022. Under that, Philippsburg 2 is to close at end-2019.    Before Fukushima, German nuclear capacity had amounted to around 21,500 MW.    Reactors stop for regular maintenances with fuel element exchanges.

"FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Software AG has appointed a new chief salesman, marking the first key personnel decision by new CEO Sanjay Brahmawar as Germany's No.2 business software company embarks on a strategy review. John Schweitzer will become chief customer officer and a member of the executive board, effective Nov. 1, succeeding Frenchman Eric Duffaut who will leave the company, the firm said in a statement. Schweitzer, 50, joins from Workday where he was president for the Americas. He previously had a global sales role at SAP - the leading German enterprise solutions company. He will be based in Silicon Valley. Software AG, which turns 50 next year, is one of the oldest companies in the industry. It is seeking a new lease of life by carving out an Internet of Things (IoT) division, a play on the digitalisation of manufacturing processes. Brahmawar, himself a veteran of IBM, will present the strategy 'refresh' next February. He said last week he would look at possible acquisitions in data integration as part of the process.

"(Recasts throughout with details from conference call; adds analyst, CEO comments) Nov 13 (Reuters) - Canada Goose Holdings Inc said earlier-than-usual shipments of its parkas and jackets to retailers would hurt its wholesale business in the current quarter and that its Hong Kong store came under pressure from protests in the city. Shares of Canada Goose fell 10% on Wednesday, erasing premarket gains, after the company said third-quarter revenue from wholesale, its biggest business by sales, would decrease in the mid-teens on a percentage basis from a year earlier. ""We've shipped so much of our fall/winter order book earlier, which naturally means less shipments in the next quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer Dani Reiss told analysts on a conference call. Canada Goose - whose products are sold in department stores including Macy's-owned Bloomingdales and Nordstrom Inc - depends largely on its wholesale business, even as it expands its retail and online operations. Revenue from Canada Goose's wholesale business jumped 22.2% to C$219.8 million in the second quarter, while revenue from its retail stores and online operations surged 47% to C$74.2 million. The Toronto-based company, known for its $1,000 parkas, opened flagship stores in Beijing and Hong Kong last year to cater to a growing appetite for luxury goods among affluent Chinese. However, the ongoing five-month long unrest in Hong Kong has hurt sales for many retailers including Ralph Lauren, Coach handbag-maker Tapesty and Michael Kors owner Capri Holdings. ""They were warning that Hong Kong is having an even greater impact,"" said John Morris, a brand apparel analyst with D.A. Davidson & Co. Canada Goose also said investments in new store and a rise in marketing spending to bolster its high-margin online business could also weigh on the current quarter. Excluding items, the company reported a profit of 57 Canadian cents per share in the quarter ended Sept. 29. Analysts were expecting a profit of 43 Canadian cents. Overall, revenue rose 27.7% to C$294 million ($222.2 million), well above analysts' estimates of C$267.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company, however, reiterated its earnings outlook for fiscal 2020. Both U.S.- and Canada-listed shares of the company were down nearly 10% at $35.17 and C$46.51, respectively.

"BANGKOK, July 28 (Reuters) - Thailand's King MahaVajiralongkorn will be exempt from tax on some of his landproperty, according to a government announcement. The king, who marked his 67th birthday on Sunday, hasoverseen major changes to the way royal affairs are managedsince taking the throne in 2016. The Crown Property Bureau, which manages the multi-billiondollar holdings of the monarchy and controls huge swathes ofland in Bangkok, was placed under the king's direct control in2017. Its previous tax exempt status was then removed. But some of the king's lands and establishments will now beexempt from tax, according to the new legislation published inthe Royal Gazette on Friday. They include lands and establishments that are ""used instate affairs, royal affairs, or used by agencies under theking"", the document said. Properties used in other affairs by the king or members ofthe royal family, for public interests, or used as religiousplaces will also be tax-free. Those that do not fit the above descriptions will betax-free ""only in the parts that are used for non-profitpurposes"", the document added.

"FRANKFURT, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Allianz is lowering the payouts on life insurance policies, paying tribute to low and negative central bank interest rates, the German insurer said on Monday. Customers with classic life insurance policies will receive 3.1% interest payments in 2020, compared with 3.4% in 2019, while customers of its Perspektive products with limited guarantees will get 3.4%, also 0.3 percentage points lower. In its new business, 90% of contracts are Perspektive products, which were introduced a few years ago, while the bulk of existing clients still have classic contracts. Allianz had kept the payouts stable for three years, while most competitors continually lowered payouts as the industry struggled to make returns on investments as interest rates have decreased. Allianz said it is pouring more money into alternative investments such as commercial property and infrastructure to boost its returns.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong-January 13: Fitch Ratings has assigned Bank of China Limited's (BOC, A/Stable) long-term senior unsecured notes issued under its USD40 billion medium-term note (MTN) programme final ratings of 'A'. The rated notes comprise: Issued by Hong Kong branch and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange -USD1 billion floating-rate notes due 2022 -USD600 million 2.375% notes due 2025 Issued by BOC (Luxembourg) S.A. and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Euro MTF market on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange -EUR800 million 0.125% notes due 2023 The final ratings on the notes are in line with the expected rating assigned on 9 January 2020 and follow the receipt of documents conforming to information previously received. Fitch first rated BOC's MTN programme on 9 December 2013, with the most recent affirmation on 29 October 2019. The programme's size was increased to USD40 billion, from USD30 billion, in April 2018 to meet the bank's funding needs. Bank of China Limited ----senior unsecured; Long Term Rating; New Rating; A Key Rating Drivers BOC's Hong Kong branch is part of the same legal entity as BOC. BOC (Luxembourg) S.A. is a separate legal entity but the notes issued by the subsidiary are guaranteed by BOC's Luxembourg branch, which is part of the same legal entity as BOC. Therefore, the notes represent direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of BOC and are rated in line with its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating, which is underpinned by the agency's expectations of an extremely high probability of support from the Chinese sovereign (A+/Stable) in the event of stress. RATING SENSITIVITIES Any change to the notes' rating will be correlated directly with changes in BOC's Issuer Default Rating, which will in turn reflect any shift in the perceived willingness or ability of the government to support the bank in a full and timely manner. While the criteria listed below were used in the committee, only the Bank Rating Criteria is relevant for this action. Date of Relevant Committee 28-Oct-2019 ESG Considerations Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of environmental, social and governance (ESG) credit relevance is a score of 3 - ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on BOC, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the bank. BOC has an ESG Relevance Score of 4 for financial transparency risk due to under-reporting of non-performing loans and risk-weighted assets stemming from the use of off-balance-sheet transactions. This negatively affects the bank's credit profile and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. The bank is also given an ESG Relevance Score of 4 for governance structure risk, as there is potential for significant state influence as the owner or regulatory influence given the lack of independence from the state. This negatively affects the bank's credit profile and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

"QUITO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Ecuador's economy is expected to expand 1.1 percent in 2018, the country's central bank chief said on Tuesday, down from its prior forecast for 2 percent growth, due to a reduction in public spending as the government tries to balance its fiscal accounts. The bank's director, Veronica Artola, told reporters the bank did not yet have a forecast for 2019, but that she did not expect a return to strong growth until 2020. ""These are years of adjustment because we are trying to have more solid public finances and reduce the fiscal deficit, and that will have an impact on the economy,"" Artola said. The South American country is adopting austerity measures under President Lenin Moreno to try to reduce its primary and overall fiscal deficit, which includes debt servicing. They are expected to close the year at 1.2 percent and 4.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. The economy grew a modest 0.9 percent year-over-year in the second quarter of 2018, central bank figures show, due to a sharp decline in the OPEC nation's oil sector.

"SINGAPORE, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Singapore's port authority has so far invested S$26 million ($19 million) into developing cleaner-burning liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a marine fuel at the city-state, the world's largest marine refuelling hub, an executive at the port authority said. ""We've been working to develop LNG-bunkering in Singapore since about late-2015,"" said Alan Lim, deputy director at the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) of Singapore, told Reuters at the sidelines of the Singapore International Bunkering Conference and Exhibition on Tuesday. The bulk of the investments, totalling about S$18 million, were directed at co-funding the construction of LNG-powered vessels including tug boats, Lim said. The remainder was directed at developing the use of LNG in the marine refuelling, also known as bunkering, sector. These included S$6 million for the construction of two barges capable of supplying ships with LNG bunkers through ship-to-ship transfers, as well as S$2 million for the development LNG-bunker trucking facilities at the Singapore LNG (SLNG) Terminal. The investments come ahead of growing pressures on the global shipping industry to reduce its emissions footprint and as new limits on the sulphur content of marine fuels come into effect from 2020. Using LNG to power ships instead of fuel oil or marine gasoil can reduce emissions of the pollutants nitrogen oxide and sulphur oxide by 90 percent to 95 percent, according to industry estimates. Singapore is the world's largest bunkering hub with record sales of 50.6 million tonnes of fuel in 2017.

"By Jessica DiNapoli and Svea Herbst-Bayliss NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Okapi Partners, a proxy solicitor that has long worked for activist hedge funds Elliott Management and Starboard Value, is hiring a senior executive from an advisory firm to help expand its business with corporate clients, three people familiar with the matter said this week. Okapi, which specializes in guiding clients through shareholder votes on proxy contests at companies like Campbell Soup and planned mergers like this year's Bristol-Myers Squibb takeover of Celgene, recruited Mark Harnett, an industry veteran, to join later this month. Harnett,60, most recently worked at public relations firm Sard Verbinnen & Co's corporate governance advisory unit, Strategic Governance Advisors, which was launched by former Institutional Shareholder Services executive Chris Cernich in 2016. Harnett's last day at Strategic Governance Advisors was Thursday. He joined Sard's public relations business in 2015. The bulk of his career was spent counting votes in corporate battles at MacKenzie Partners, the proxy solicitor he co-founded with Daniel Burch in 1992. He worked there until 2015. After a few years of advising corporate clients on how to engage with activist investors, Harnett was ready to return to his roots and the nitty-gritty work of vote counting, the sources said. Okapi was founded by Bruce Goldfarb and Patrick McHugh, who worked together at proxy solicitor Georgeson Inc., at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 when activism was finding fresh traction. The firm has a reputation for working with activists like Elliott and Starboard but it also has other types of clients such as mutual fund firms. Since its founding, pressure from activists on companies has steadily increased. Last year, for example, was a banner year for activists who put more capital to work than ever before, targeted a record number of companies and won a record number of board seats, data from Lazard show. While many activists lost money last year, their returns have largely rebounded this year with a handful including Pershing Square Capital Management, ValueAct Capital, Trian Fund Management and Starboard Value posting double digit returns in the first half, according to investors.

"Nov 29 (Reuters) - Italian broadcaster Mediaset and shareholder Vivendi were negotiating on Friday to find a way to end a three-year legal battle after all-night talks failed to produce a breakthrough, sources said. Following are twists and turns in their dispute. April 2016 - Vivendi agrees to buy Mediaset's pay-TV business, billed as a major step in billionaire businessman Vincent Bollore's plan to build a southern European content and video-on-demand powerhouse. The two companies agree to take a 3.5% stake in each other as part of the deal. July 2016 - Vivendi backs away from the original deal, proposing an alternative that would give it a bigger direct stake in the broadcaster than originally agreed. Vivendi says the main reason for the change is the unreliability of Mediaset Premium's annual financial forecasts over the 2016-2018 period. The deal falls apart as Mediaset rejects the new proposal by Vivendi and announces legal action against the French group. Dec. 2016 Vivendi builds up a 28.8% stake in Mediaset over the month in a moved condemned by the Italian broadcaster. April 2017 An Italian regulator orders Vivendi, which is also the top shareholder in Telecom Italia, to cut its stake in either the telecoms group or Mediaset within a year to comply with rules designed to prevent a concentration of power. Oct. 2017 Police raid the Paris headquarters of Vivendi as part of an investigation into alleged market abuse involving its purchase of the Mediaset stake. Vivendi says the raid is the result of an ""unfounded and unjust complaint"" by former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose holding company Fininvest is the top investor in Mediaset. April 2018 Vivendi transfers 19.19 percent of its shareholding in Mediaset to a trust to comply with the April 2017 ruling by the Italian communications regulator. The legal battle between the two companies continues on multiple fronts, including a 3 billion euro damage request by Mediaset over the failed pay-TV deal and repeated complaints by Vivendi about not being allowed to exercise its voting rights at Mediaset shareholder meetings. Sept. 2019 Mediaset shareholders back a plan, unveiled in June, to create a pan-European media group under a new Dutch holding, fending off opposition from Vivendi. Under the plan, both Mediaset and its Spanish unit will be merged into a Dutch company dubbed MediaForEurope (MFE). Vivendi, which says the new structure tightens the grip of Fininvest on the group, challenges the plan in court both in Spain and Italy. Nov. 2019 Mediaset raises its stake in German rival ProSiebensat.1 to 15.1% as it presses ahead with plans to create a pan-European TV platform.

"By Karolos Grohmann LAUSANNE, Switzerland, Dec 5 (Reuters) - FIFA president Gianni Infantino has been proposed for International Olympic Committee membership, but World Athletics head Sebastian Coe will have to wait due to a conflict of interest, IOC President Thomas Bach said on Thursday. FIFA and World Athletics, the governing bodies of two of the biggest sports in the Olympics, have been without membership ever since the departure from the IOC of their respective former presidents Sepp Blatter and Lamine Diack in 2015. For years, membership of the IOC for the heads of soccer and athletics was seen as almost automatic. Yet the two international federations have been left out in the cold as they struggled with widespread corruption and doping scandals which tarnished their images. Diack, who has denied wrongdoing, faces a corruption trial in France in January. Bach said Infantino had been proposed for election at their next session in January along with International Tennis Federation chief David Haggerty and Japanese Olympic Committee president Yasuhiro Yamashita. World Athletics chief Coe, however, had not been proposed due to a conflict of interest. ""We wanted him (Coe) to become an IOC member as president of one of our most important Olympic sports,"" Bach said. ""Since then we are in close consultation with him and since then we have addressed the risk of a potential of conflict of interest he may have."" Apart for his role at World Athletics, Coe is also Group Chairman of consultancy firm CSM which also works with the IOC. ""CSM is consulting various organisations and stakeholders including having contractual partnerships with the IOC itself."" Bach said Coe had informed them that he could not immediately resolve this situation but was working on it. Bach said Coe could become a member at their session during the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. ""He is hopeful to address it in a couple of months. Then that would mean the door is still open for Tokyo."" The IOC elects new members at its sessions once candidates are vetted by the Olympic body.

Businessman Michael Spavor, who worked with North Korea, andformer diplomat Michael Kovrig were picked up separately inDecember, shortly after Canada arrested Huawei Technologies CoLtd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, who facesextradition to the United States. China has repeatedly demanded Meng be released, and hasreacted angrily to extradition proceedings against her in aCanadian court. ""According to Chinese prosecutors' approval, Michael Kovrig,due to being suspected of crimes of gathering state secrets andintelligence for foreign (forces), and Michael Spavor, for beingsuspected of crimes of stealing and illegally providing statesecrets for foreign (forces), have in recent days been approvedfor arrest according to law,"" foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kangtold a daily news briefing. The measures were in accordance with the law, Lu said, andBeijing hoped Canada ""will not make irresponsible remarks"" aboutlaw enforcement and judicial proceedings in China. The Canadian embassy in Beijing referred questions toOttawa. Canadian diplomats have been allowed to visit the two men indetention. In March, China accused the two of involvement in stealingstate secrets. China has said it is fully guaranteeing both men's lawfulrights. Kovrig also holds Hungarian citizenship. Kovrig works for the International Crisis Group (ICG)non-governmental organisation which focuses on conflictresolution. With their formal arrest, they could soon face trial, thoughit is unclear when that may be. While Canada says China has made no specific link betweenthe detentions of the two men and Meng's arrest, experts andformer diplomats say they have no doubt it is using their casesto pressure Canada. Meng, 47, is the daughter of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd'sbillionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei.

"ISTANBUL, April 7 (Reuters) - Turkey on Sunday criticisedIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as ""irresponsible"" forsaying he would annex Israeli settlements in the occupied WestBank if he wins Tuesday's election. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the West Bank, whichIsrael seized in the 1967 Middle East war, was Palestinianterritory and Israel's occupation violated international law. ""Prime Minister Netanyahu’s irresponsible statement to seekvotes just before the Israeli general elections cannot and willnot change this fact,"" Cavusoglu tweeted. Netanyahu, asked why he had not declared Israeli sovereigntyover large West Bank settlements as Israel has already done inthe occupied Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, said he wasalready discussing the move. ""I am going to extend (Israeli) sovereignty and I don'tdistinguish between settlement blocs and the isolatedsettlements,"" he told Israel's Channel 12 News on Saturday.

"(Adds foreign minister comments) By Olesya Astakhova and Vladimir Soldatkin MINERALNYE VODY/MOSCOW, Russia, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Russia said on Friday it needed more time to decide whether to join any additional oil output cuts by OPEC, saying U.S. crude production growth would slow and global demand remained solid. Energy Minister Alexander Novak was speaking as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pushes Moscow to make a decision on whether to cut output more in response to the coronavirus outbreak that has hit the global economy. A technical panel that advises OPEC and its allies, led by Russia - a grouping known as OPEC+ - proposed on Thursday a provisional cut of 600,000 barrels per day (bpd), three sources told Reuters. Producers in OPEC+ are scheduled to meet in Vienna on March 5-6, although the meeting could be brought forward depending on how the coronavirus outbreak affects oil prices. Novak said Moscow needed more time to assess the situation, stopping short of giving a clear Russian position on the proposal. Oil prices have come under pressure recently in the absence of a Russian response to calls for more output cuts. ""I can't tell you about my position right now, maybe we will say it next week,"" Novak said when asked about Moscow's position. ""Russia needs a few days for market analysis."" Crude prices fell on Friday following Novak's comments. They had rallied earlier on remarks from Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that were initially seen as being more upbeat about the proposal to cut output. Speaking at a news conference in Mexico City on Thursday, Lavrov said via interpreters that Moscow supported ""the idea"", when asked about the proposal. However, a foreign ministry transcript of his comments suggested he was speaking in general terms. Lavrov was asked: ""Is Russia planning to support the call by OPEC+ to cut oil production, as was suggested at a recent emergency meeting?"" He replied: ""We are actively supporting cooperation within the framework of OPEC+ and collaboration between oil exporting countries, including both OPEC and non-OPEC countries."" On Friday, Novak said global oil demand might fall by 150,000 to 200,000 bpd this year due to the virus outbreak and other negative factors, lower than other forecasts. Novak said his estimate was ""an insignificant volume, taking into account that the volatility in consumption also depends on many factors, such as Libya, Iran, Venezuela, where supply is also quite volatile"". Others have suggested a much bigger impact. BP said a global slowdown was expected to reduce 2020 oil demand growth by 300,000-500,000 bpd, or up to 0.5% of total demand. Novak also said U.S. oil output was not expanding as fast as before. ""Growth is slowing down in the United States. It was 1.3 million bpd last year ... This year, we expect less than 1 million,"" he said. ""Oil production growth is slowing down there due to lower prices.""

"* Canals once a tourist attraction * Obsolete sanitation has left stinking waterways * Residents forced to buy water for drinking, bathing * Problem has sparked large protests * New water treatment plant faces delay By Mohammed Kadhim Atti BASRA, Iraq, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Once dubbed the “Venice of the Middle East” for its canals, Iraq's crumbling port city of Basra is slowly dying of thirst. Crisscrossed waterways that earned it comparisons with the Italian city are now filthy pools of stagnant water. Its vibrant freshwater lifeline, the Shatt-al-Arab river that runs through it, is now so polluted it threatens the lives of the more than 4 million inhabitants of Iraq's second city. ""It now causes death. It is highly polluted. Different pollutants can be found in the river, including germs, chemicals, toxic algae coupled with unprecedented concentrations of salt almost like that of seawater, rather, it is indeed seawater,"" said Shukri al-Hassan, Marine Science lecturer at Basra University. According to Hassan, contamination levels of Shatt-al-Arab have increased four-fold over the past 10 years and are increasing, putting more and more people at risk. LETHAL MIX Daily life also features open sewers and streets filled with fetid piles of garbage. In response, furious residents recently staged some of the biggest protests in years. Many contrast their impoverishment with the oil wealth the province provides to the federal government's coffers. State officials blame a public funding crisis wrought by years of low oil prices for the hardship in a city that was a magnet for Middle Eastern tourists until the early 1980s. Local resident Raad Shabout Dhahar said the water crisis is just one of many problems that have left his 17-member family, including two wives, his mother and 14 daughters, in despair. ""It has become even harder because if one used to earn 10,000 Iraqi dinars ($8.43) a day, one can spend five thousand on food and save the other five, while now, we really started to feel the pinch,"" he said. ""Before a quantity of 500 litres of water was enough for us as we used it for drinking only. We did not use it for washing our faces and clothes and we did not use it for bathing. But now, the 500 litres are used also to wash our faces and bodies, too."" CESSPOOLS Located where the Euphrates and Tigris rivers merge near the Gulf at Iraq’s marshy southern tip, Basra is one of the few cities in the Middle East without an effective water treatment system. It had an advanced sanitary infrastructure in the 1960s but that broke down decades ago, turning waterways into cesspools whose stench is compounded by the hot desert climate. Residents said the water crisis has added to misery caused by shattered infrastructure because of years of under-investment, first under Sunni leader Saddam Hussein and then successive Shi'ite-led governments. Much of Iraq suffered destruction in a string of ruinous wars since the 1980s. But Basra was especially hard hit as a city on the front line of the war with Iran, only a few dozen kilometres across the Shatt-al-Arab delta to the east. The city has yet to recover. Basra residents say salt seeping into the water supply has made it undrinkable and sent hundreds to hospital. Some 90,000 people have been admitted to hospital, according to the head of Basra's health department, Riyadh Abdull Amir, with as many as 4,000 a day seeking treating this month. Resident Aqeel Shakir Abdul Majeed had little hope for the future as he waited to pay for fresh water. ""How can poor people afford it? How can those who do not have money afford it,"" he said. ""Will they steal to get money? I do not know what to do."" To improve water supply, the central government is building a major water treatment plant and a desalination complex thanks to a Japanese loan. The project was expected to be completed by the end of the year, but the departure of Japanese experts due to threats during protests has delayed the process.

"* U.S. says Huawei used to enable Chinese spying * British official says no evidence of malicious activity * UK govt yet to decide on 5G security policy - official * Britain a key battleground for Huawei in Europe(Adds comment from U.S. senator) By Jack Stubbs and Foo Yun Chee LONDON/BRUSSELS, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Britain is able tomanage the security risks of using Huawei telecoms equipment andhas not seen any evidence of malicious activity by the company,a senior official said on Wednesday, pushing back against U.S.allegations of Chinese state spying. Ciaran Martin, head of Britain's National Cyber SecurityCentre (NCSC), said Britain had yet to decide on its securitypolicy for national 5G networks, but that Huawei equipment wassubject to detailed oversight and strict government controlsover where it was used. ""Our regime is arguably the toughest and most rigorousoversight regime in the world for Huawei,"" Martin, whose NCSC ispart of Britain's GCHQ intelligence agency, said at acybersecurity conference in Brussels. Asked later whether Washington had presented Britain withany evidence to support its allegations, he told reporters: ""Iwould be obliged to report if there was evidence of malevolence... by Huawei. And we're yet to have to do that. So I hope thatcovers it."" Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment,faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship withthe Chinese government and U.S.-led allegations of enablingstate espionage, with Washington calling for allies not to usethe company's technology. No evidence has been produced publicly and Huawei hasrepeatedly denied the claims, but the allegations have ledseveral Western countries to restrict the company's access totheir markets. Martin said it was for the U.S. government to comment onwhat information it had about the company but added: ""From ourpoint of view ... if you look at the detailed paper we'republishing, we set out the way we manage the risks."" U.S. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S.Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, responded by saying hewanted to ""more fully understand the UK's reasoning."" ""The United States and its allies need to maintain a commonfront against the supply chain risk of equipment from countriesthat do not respect the rule of law and that routinely placeextra-judicial surveillance demands on domestic firms,"" he said. Huawei had no immediate comment. HUAWEI UNDER FIRE Britain is a key battleground for Huawei in its campaign toresist U.S. pressure in Europe. Any decision by London to allow the Chinese company toparticipate in building next-generation 5G networks would bewatched closely by other nations because of Britain's membershipof the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group along with theUnited States. But the company has come under fire in Britain since agovernment report in July last year found that technical andsupply-chain issues with its equipment had exposed nationaltelecoms networks to new security risks. Vodafone, the world's second-largest mobileoperator, said last month it was ""pausing"" deployment of Huaweiequipment in core networks until Western governments give fullsecurity clearance. Other operators in Europe, including Britain's BT andFrance's Orange, have already removed Huawei'sequipment or taken steps to limit its future use. Commenting on the report, Martin said: ""As we said then, andrepeat today, these problems are about standards of cybersecurity; they are not indicators of hostile activity by China."" Martin said Huawei had pledged to address the problems butacknowledged that doing so would take some years. ""We will monitor and report on progress and we will notdeclare the problems are on the path to being solved unless anduntil there is clear evidence that this is the case,"" he said. ""We will not compromise on the improvements we need to seefrom Huawei.""

"By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, March 18 (Reuters) - Flooding at a U.S. AirForce base in Nebraska that damaged buildings and forced theremoval of a plane integral to the nation's nuclear attackresponse highlight the risks climate change poses to nationalsecurity, experts said on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly questionedwhether humans cause climate change and has been angered byassessments from his military and intelligence agencies that saythe phenomenon poses national security risks. Last week's ""bomb cyclone"" storm flooded about 60 structuresincluding 30 buildings at the Offutt Air Force Base, said RyanHansen, a spokesman for the 55th Wing, a unit providingreconnaissance, intelligence and combat support to U.S. leaders. Eight planes in the 55th Wing had to leave the base, Hansensaid, and workers might not be able to assess damage to hangersand maintenance buildings until the end of the week. One of the planes was a Boeing-made E4-B plane, one four theAir Force has that are meant to serve as an aerial commandcenter in case of national emergency or destruction of groundbases, such as in a nuclear attack. Two E4-B's were alsodamaged by a tornado at Offutt in 2017, CNN reported at thetime. Francesco Femia, the co-founder of the Center for Climateand Security, said the flooding shows that the White House needsto let the military do its job in assessing the climate threat. ""This is an example of a vital threat to our nationalsecurity from a climate-related disaster, and more of this kindof thing is likely in the future,"" Femia said. While flooding from storm surges linked to climate changethat could damage sensitive electronics and mechanical equipmenthave long threatened U.S. Naval bases like Norfolk, Virginia,Offutt is a reminder that climate change also poses risks tobases far from sea. Offutt is also home to Strategic Command, which oversees thecountry's nuclear arsenal. The Strategic Command headquarters,set on a hill, was not affected by the floods, and neither wasits new building, expected to open in the spring. ""Given the president's denial of climate change ...

The White House has considered forming a panel to assess thescience used in government climate risk reports that could beheaded by a retired physics professor who believes greenhousegas emissions are good for the planet. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. While climate change can't be blamed for a single storm,the vast majority of scientists say emissions from fossil fuelsand the burning of forests are trapping heat in the atmosphereand making storms and floods more intense.(Reporting by Timothy GardnerEditing by Bill Berkrot)",Flooded U.S. Air Force base underscores climate risk to security -experts,flooding at a u.s. airforce base in nebraska damaged buildings and forced theremoval of a plane integral to the nation's nuclear attack response. president donald trump has repeatedly questionedwhether humans cause climate change.,floods at u.s . air force base in nebraska highlight security risks from climate change - experts

"* Palladium hits record $1,700.71/oz; on track for 9% gain in Sept * Gold eyes first monthly loss in five * Silver on track for best quarter in 10 (Updates prices, adds graphics) By Sumita Layek Sept 30 (Reuters) - Platinum plunged more than 5% and gold shed 2% on Monday, leading a sharp decline across precious metals driven by a soaring dollar, with deficit-hit palladium too giving up some gains from a record rally that saw it breach $1,700 per ounce. Silver slid more than 3% to its lowest in more than a month. Spot palladium eased 0.6% to $1,670.45 an ounce by 02:23 p.m. EDT (1823 GMT), having earlier touched a record high of $1,700.71. The metal has risen about 9% this month. ""There is strong fabrication demand but a good part of this is speculative demand from investors who expect prices to rise and also people who are getting out of gold, silver and platinum because those prices are falling, some of them are shifting into palladium,"" said Jeffrey Christian, managing partner of CPM Group. ""There's a lot of concern that there isn't a lot of palladium around; a big part of that is people who own the metal don't want to sell at current prices. They want to see how high the price goes before they keep their profits."" The price of palladium, used mainly in emissions-reducing catalysts for vehicles, has risen about 33% this year and nearly 9% this quarter, despite a weakening auto sector, due to tight supply. Meanwhile, gold shed 1.7% to $1,471.09 after the dollar hit multi-year highs, making the dollar-denominated metal more expensive for holders of other currencies. Earlier, prices fell about 2% to their lowest since Aug. 6 at $1,463.99, with bullion also marking its first monthly decline in five. For the quarter, however, bullion has risen more than 4% so far. U.S. gold futures for December settled down 2.2%, at $1,472.90. ""Gold and silver ... continue to decline on a slightly firmer dollar and a relatively uneventful geopolitical landscape,"" INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said in a note. Also weighing on gold, stocks firmed after Washington's dismissal of a report from Friday, which had said the U.S. administration was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. Investors also kept a close eye on the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The central bank cut interest rates earlier in September for the second time this year. ""The Fed said they're going to be very cautious about lowering rates since it's not clear that we really need to, which was taken as a confirmation that there's a fair bit of potential growth before getting concerned about recession. So people backed away from some of the fears that drove them into gold on a short-term basis."" CPM Group's Christian said. Elsewhere, platinum dropped 5.6% at $878.86, having slumping to its lowest since Aug. 28 at $870.5 earlier. Silver shed about 2.9% to $17.04 after touching a more than one-month low of $16.89. However, both metals are up about 5.4% and 11.4% for the quarter respectively. (Reporting by Sumita Layek, Arpan Varghese and K.

"By Daniel Wiessner (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday sent class action claims that an au pair agency conspired with competitors to suppress wages and violated wage-and-hour laws to arbitration, saying its arbitration agreements were enforceable despite some problematic provisions. A unanimous three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected claims by two au pairs who alleged that various provisions of the agreements they signed with AuPairCare Inc (APC) were unfair, and that as young foreign nationals, they did not understand what arbitration was. San Francisco-based AuPairCare is one of 15 au pair agencies accused in a certified nationwide class action of various violations of federal antitrust and racketeering laws. The plaintiffs, who sued on behalf of 90,000 au pairs, also say the agencies and the families that hosted them failed to pay minimum wage under federal and state laws. APC is the only agency that had moved to send the claims to arbitration. Thomas Quinn of Gordon & Rees, who represents APC, declined to comment. APC did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did the au pair's lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner and public interest law firm Towards Justice. APC and the other agencies named in the 2014 lawsuit in federal court in Colorado are authorized by the U.S. State Department to sponsor au pairs under the J-1 visa program. The plaintiffs say the agencies violated antitrust, racketeering, and minimum wage laws by agreeing to fix au pairs' wages at the minimum of just under $200 a week set by the State Department. The companies have said that they are visa sponsors that facilitate cultural exchange, and are not the au pairs' employers, and are immune from the antitrust claims because they were following State Department regulations. U.S. District Judge Christine Arguello certified a nationwide class in the case last year. The 10th Circuit denied the agencies' request for permission to appeal the ruling. APC last year moved to compel arbitration of the claims against it, saying the two named plaintiffs who had been placed as au pairs by the company signed valid arbitration agreements. Arguello in September 2017 said the agreements were unenforceable because the au pairs were young foreigners who spoke English as a second language, and many did not understand what arbitration was. The agreement also unfairly allowed APC to unilaterally select an arbitration provider, she said. But on Tuesday, the 10th Circuit panel said APC provided the au pairs with copies of the agreements in their native languages, and the women acknowledged that they had read and understood them. And the au pairs did not face the kind of economic pressure that some workers feel to sign such agreements, the court said, because they could choose between agencies and understood they would receive low pay. The panel agreed with the plaintiffs that the provision allowing APC to select an arbitration provider was unfair. But because that was the only unenforceable provision in the agreement, it can be severed from the rest, McHugh wrote. The panel included Circuit Judges Paul Kelly and Nancy Moritz. Au pair agency Cultural Care Inc, which is a defendant in the class action, has asked the 1st Circuit to revive its 2016 lawsuit seeking a declaration that a Massachusetts law setting a minimum wage for domestic workers does not apply to au pairs, as the state claims it does. Last month, the State Department in an amicus brief backing Cultural Care said its visa regulations preempt state and local wage laws. The case is Beltran v. Interexchange, 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 17-1359.

"    SHANGHAI, Nov 15 (Reuters) - China's yuan edged higher against the dollar on Thursday, as the greenback slipped while signs of easing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington boosted market sentiment.     The dollar weakened against the pound and euro, which rose after Britain's prime minister won cabinet approval for her draft Brexit plan, although concerns about whether it can clear parliamentary hurdles capped broader gains.     China has delivered a written response to U.S. demands for trade reforms, three U.S. government sources told Reuters on Wednesday, which could spur negotiations to end a withering trade war between the world's top economies.     Market participants believe Chinese authorities are keen to prevent the yuan from weakening too sharply before U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet at the end of this month at a G20 summit in Argentina.      Prior to market opening on Thursday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate at 6.9392 per dollar, 10 pips firmer than the previous fix of 6.9402.      In the spot market, the onshore yuan opened at 6.9450 per dollar and rose to 6.9473 before changing hands at 6.9401 at midday, 99 pips firmer than the previous late session close.     The onshore spot yuan swung in a tight range of less than 80 pips on Thursday morning, as dollar buying interest from corporate clients emerged at above 6.94 per dollar levels, capping the gains in the yuan.     Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at OANDA, said in a note the PBOC ""will keep the markets' top side ambitions (for USD/yuan) in check as it would be reasonable to assume regulators don't want the yuan to weaken ahead of G-20 negotiations.""      On Thursday, signs of liquidity tightness in the offshore yuan market also lent support for the Chinese unit.     Hong Kong's offshore yuan overnight borrowing rate, or HIBOR, was fixed at 2.85567 percent on Thursday, more than 1 percentage point higher than the previous day's fix of 1.80900 percent, which had been the highest since Oct. 10.

"* S&P500 futures gain after Mnuchin comments on trade talks * Dismal euro zone data hurts euro, deepens anxiety about economy * European shares seen up 0.2-0.3% * Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Global shares edged up on Tuesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed U.S.-China trade talks will resume next month, but lingering concerns about slowing global growth  reduced the overall appetite for riskier assets. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan inched up 0.1%, led by 0.6% gains in mainland Chinese shares after the vice head of China's state planner said Beijing will step up efforts to stabilise growth. Japan's Nikkei was up 0.2% after a market holiday on Monday while European shares are also on track to open higher, with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.26%, German DAX futures up 0.24% and FTSE futures up 0.33%. U.S. stock futures gained 0.38%, helped by comments from Mnuchin that U.S.-China trade talks will resume next week. He later clarified that the negotiations will take place in two weeks. ""The comments gave a little bit of boost to sentiment, but markets are still not that optimistic either,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management. ""It seems there have been a lot going on behind the scenes,"" he said, referring to unusual exchanges in which U.S. President Donald Trump questioned a decision by his top trade negotiators to ask Chinese officials to delay a planned trip to U.S. farming regions. That cancellation was seen by markets as a sign all is not well in the U.S.-China talks and helped send share prices lower on Friday. The dispute between the world's two largest economies has dragged on for well over a year, rattling investors and denting global growth. Concerns over a slowing global economy remained front and centre for financial markets, hurting earnings estimates, as poor business activity readings from the euro zone deepened fears of a recession and suggested more stimulus was required. ""While the Nikkei was fairly well supported, we need more catalysts to further rises. That's also true for U.S. markets as well,"" said Takeo Kamai, head of execution service at CLSA. ""Although speculators have reacted to the trade-related headlines, real-money people appear to be staying on the sideline."" The euro wobbled at $1.0987, falling below a key support around $1.10 and not far from a 28-month low of $1.0926 touched earlier this month. Sterling also slipped to $1.2431, after peaked at a two-month high of $1.2582 set on Friday as traders awaited a Supreme Court ruling on whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson misled Queen Elizabeth over his reasons for suspending parliament this month. The Supreme Court said it will issue its decision at 0930 GMT on Tuesday. The collapse of the British travel firm Thomas Cook could also put some pressure on the pound by highlighting the weakness of British retailing. The yen traded at 107.62 yen per dollar, having hit two-week highs of 107.32 on Monday. U.S. Treasuries yields extended their decline, with the 10-year rate falling to 1.716%, edging down further from 1.908% marked on Sept. 13. Oil prices also dipped amid gloomy demand outlook as investors fret about a global slowdown although uncertainty on whether Saudi Arabia would be able to restore full output after the attacks on its facilities provided some support. Brent crude futures fell 0.52% to $64.43 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.48% to $58.36 per barrel.

"By Luis Jaime Acosta MIRAVALLE, Colombia, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The nine former rebel fighters, who traded their guns, battle fatigues and heavy rucksacks for paddles, helmets and life jackets, launch four rafts laden with visitors into the turbulent Pato River, deep in Colombia's dense Amazon jungle. The former guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have chosen rafting as their path to reintegration, as the government pushes to make tourism a top engine of the Andean nation's economy. ""During the conflict, this region was rough, there were bullets and bombs all the time. Today, so much has changed - many people come to see the waterfalls, the mountain, the river,"" guide Duberney Moreno, 34, a 13-year veteran of the FARC, said on Friday. Nearly 13,000 former combatants and their unarmed sympathizers are participating in a reintegration process agreed as part of a 2016 peace deal to end more than 52 years of war with the government. Reincorporation is considered fundamental to ensuring former FARC members do not return to the battlefield with smaller rebel group the National Liberation Army (ELN), numerous crime gangs and dissident groups that refused to demobilize. The conflict in Colombia has killed more than 260,000 people and millions more have been displaced, suffered sexual violence or been maimed by land mines or bombs. Implementation of the polarizing deal has advanced slowly, but the FARC is now a political party with 10 guaranteed seats in Congress through 2026. Many former fighters have returned home to reunite with their families, but some 5,000 have remained in 24 demobilization zones like the one on the Pato, turning them into makeshift towns built on Marxist principles. CERTIFIED RAFTERS The government has budgeted some $1.6 million to help those in the zones, which are protected by government forces, start some 300 farming, ranching, shoemaking, fishery, woodworking and now tourism projects. Many ex-combatants, most of whom come from poor, rural backgrounds, have also contributed the money they were given upon demobilization to the projects. Moreno and eight other former fighters got 200 hours of guide training and are now certified by the International Rafting Federation. The site in Caqueta province cost $20,000 to construct and features hiking trails and lodging. Former fighters cook meals and drive visitors two hours by rutted road from the nearest large town. ""We have to keep supporting these initiatives - they create confidence in the peace process,"" said Jessica Faieta, deputy chief of the United Nations' mission in Colombia, which helps manage reintegration. President Ivan Duque, who took office in August, has said tourism could be the country's new economic driver. Travel to Colombia has spiked in recent years, as stereotypes about violence are offset by positive media coverage of the country's diverse destinations. ""I want tourism to be Colombia's new oil and for it to be the great invigorator of economic activity,"" Duque said at a recent event. More than 3.3 million tourists visited Colombia in 2017, a 23.9 percent jump from 2016. Figures from the past two years were more than double rates in 2010 and before, when just 1.4 million people visited. The government estimates tourism has the potential to generate $6 billion annually and some 300,000 jobs. Colombia has coastline on both the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, Amazonian jungle, Andean glaciers and cosmopolitan urban areas, as well as a plethora of adventure sports and wildlife. Moreno and his colleagues are optimistic about their future on the river. ""We want peace,"" Moreno said, standing on a beach along the Pato in the suffocating heat. ""We believe a different Colombia is possible.""

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-New York-October 15: Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'AA-' rating to $2.755 million of state of Oklahoma, Oklahoma Development Finance Authority (ODFA) Oklahoma state system of higher education, master equipment lease revenue bonds, tax-exempt series 2018A (subject to annual appropriation). The bonds are expected to sell via negotiation on or about Oct. 30, 2018. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The bonds are limited special obligations of the ODFA secured by annual appropriations of the state of Oklahoma. The source of repayment on the bonds is from the annual appropriation to the state Board of Regents (State Regents) for higher education on behalf of certain Oklahoma colleges and universities, pursuant to a lease agreement between ODFA and the State Regents. ANALYTICAL CONCLUSION The rating on the ODFA bonds, secured by annual appropriations from the state's general fund, is one notch below Oklahoma's 'AA' Issuer Default Rating (IDR), reflecting the state's general credit standing, the sound lease structure, and statutory authorization for these types of bonds. ODFA is one of the principal financing agencies of the state, and the bonds are secured by lease rental payments by the State Regents from state general fund revenues. Both the state constitution and enabling statutes provide for appropriation of lease payments in support of the master equipment program. Additionally, the master leasing structure on behalf of the State Regents has been validated by Oklahoma's Supreme Court. All higher education appropriations to the State Regents are consolidated, with the State Regents authorized to allocate funds first to payment of lease rentals of each participating institution. The State Regents covenant to include a budget request for lease payments sufficient to pay debt service for all bonds. The enacted fiscal 2019 operating fund appropriation for the State Regents is $777 million, a modest 1% increase from the revised fiscal 2018 budget. Fitch believes the state maintains ample financial resources to fund debt service requirements for higher education debt obligations, particularly as the majority of debt service is funded by student tuition and campus fees. Oklahoma's 'AA' IDR reflects the state's conservative budgeting practices, which include strong control over spending and its practice of budgeting only 95% of expected revenue, and a low liability position. These factors are critical to the rating given the sizable economic concentration in natural resource development and growth prospects for revenue that are heavily influenced by market cycles. Economic Resource Base About one-third of the state's gross state product is attributable to the drilling, production, and economic multiplier effects of the oil and natural gas sectors. A slump in the natural resources sector from late 2014 to mid-2016 led to shuttered rigs and increased unemployment. Crude oil price increases from late 2016 through 2018 year to date have boosted rig counts and energy production, returning stability to the state's economy. Volatility related to the energy industry is expected to remain an inherent part of the state's economy into the foreseeable future. KEY RATING DRIVERS Revenue Framework:  'aa' Fitch expects Oklahoma's revenues, which are supported by broad-based sources, to continue to reflect economic volatility tied to its extensive natural resources sector. The sharp decline in energy production prices that began in 2014 challenged revenue growth and revenues have only recently improved. The state has complete control over its revenues, with an unlimited independent legal ability to raise operating revenues as needed, although a supermajority vote of the legislature or voter approval for tax rate increases limits practical flexibility. Expenditure Framework: 'aa' The state maintains ample expenditure flexibility with a low burden of carrying costs for liabilities and the broad expense-cutting ability common to most U.S. states. As with most states, Medicaid remains a key expense driver but one that Fitch expects to remain manageable. Long-Term Liability Burden:  'aaa' Debt levels are low. On a combined basis, the state's net tax-supported debt and unfunded pension obligation is well below the median for U.S. states as a percentage of personal income and a low burden on resources. Other post-employment benefit (OPEB) obligations are small. Operating Performance:  'aa' A policy of appropriating only 95% of expected General Revenue Fund (GRF) revenues provides a cushion for revenue variability while the state's proactive management of its financial operations has also historically offset volatility; however, the state was unable to provide a durable response to the recent prolonged period of low natural resource prices that suppressed its revenue sources, weakening its resiliency. The state steadily drew on balances in its rainy day fund (RDF) in recent fiscal years in addition to other non-recurring actions to achieve balance. Improving economic conditions in fiscal 2018 provided for a sizable deposit to the RDF, bringing the balance to 8% of GRF revenues. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings on the state's appropriation-backed bonds are sensitive to shifts in the state's IDR, to which they are linked. The Stable Outlook on the IDR incorporates the expectation of continued proactive fiscal management and a low liability position. A significant deviation from these assessments would put negative pressure on the rating. CREDIT PROFILE Revenue Framework Sales taxes and personal income taxes (PIT) provide almost equal support of the GRF, totaling about 72% of fiscal 2018 revenues, with additional revenue flowing from corporate income and severance taxes. The state is directed by state statute to deposit portions of tax revenues to several of its pension systems for funding of the actuarially determined contribution (ADC). Dedicated revenues include insurance premium taxes, driver's license taxes, and motor vehicle inspection fees; and a sizable 5% of revenues from sales and use taxes, PIT, corporate income taxes, and lottery proceeds support the annual contribution to the teachers' pension system. Historical growth in the state's revenues, after adjusting for the estimated impact of tax policy changes, was below the pace of national GDP growth over the 10 years through 2016, particularly when incorporating the natural resource downturn that severely impacted revenues in 2015 and 2016. The multi-year slump in commodity prices and production combined with a previously enacted PIT rate cut required significant state action to close sizable budget gaps in fiscal years 2016 through 2018, including the extensive use of one-time actions. The state eliminated the second, automatic PIT rate cut in the 2017 legislative session. Final fiscal 2018 GRF revenues were $381.6 million or 7% above projections despite some deviations in the forecast, with all revenue sources recording solid growth from fiscal 2017. Gross production taxes increased 125% year over year as both price and production recorded gains and state policy action, which boosted the horizontal drilling tax rate from 1% to 4%, was incorporated. Total GRF revenue increased 16% year over year as the economy improved and other actions of the 2017 legislature, which modified the sales tax on motor vehicle purchases and raised motor vehicle registration fee, were captured. A significant increase in revenues for fiscal 2019 is anticipated due to tax policy actions in 2018 to fund teacher and employee salary increases and programmatic adjustments. The state is currently forecasting a robust 11% increase in operating fund revenues in fiscal 2019 largely due to increases in gross production, cigarette and motor fuel taxes as well as the imposition of a cap on PIT itemized deductions. Growth in the state's economy is expected to continue to add to future revenue growth. The state has unlimited legal ability to raise revenues, although rate increases require either a supermajority vote of the legislature or a majority vote of the people. An additional constitutional restriction that prohibits enacting new revenue measures during the final week of the legislative session is also a limiting factor on the state's flexibility. Expenditure Framework As in most states, education and health and human services spending are Oklahoma's largest operating expenses. Education is the larger line item, as the state provides significant funding for local school districts and the public university and college system. Health and human services spending is the second largest area of spending, with Medicaid being the primary driver. Federal action to revise Medicaid's programmatic and financial structure, including a basic restructuring of federal Medicaid funding to a capped amount, remains a possibility. Whether a change in Medicaid funding has consequences for Fitch's assessment of a state's credit quality would depend on the state's fiscal response to those changes. Responses that create long-term structural deficits or increased liability burdens could negatively affect both the expenditure framework assessment and the IDR. Fitch expects that spending growth, absent policy actions, will be marginally ahead of natural revenue growth, driven primarily by Medicaid, and require regular budget adjustments to ensure ongoing balance. The fiscal challenge of Medicaid is common to all U.S. states and the nature of the program as well as federal government rules limit the states' options in managing the pace of spending growth. Spending growth increases significantly in the fiscal 2019 budget as the state is funding teacher and employee salary raises and primary education increases in addition to restoring funds to other areas of the budget that were reduced during the downturn. Tax policy actions by the legislature provide recurring sources of revenue for these expenditures. Overall, Oklahoma retains ample ability to adjust expenditures to meet changing fiscal circumstances. While Medicaid remains a notable cost pressure, spending requirements for debt service, pension, and other post-employment expense (OPEB) are low; carrying costs accounted for only 5% of expenditures in fiscal 2017. Pension contributions over the past several years have been significantly above the ADC as the state dedicates certain portions of various taxes to pension liabilities. Long-Term Liability Burden The state is a frequent issuer of debt although overall levels remain modest; most debt issuance is backed by annual appropriations from the state legislature. Outstanding general obligation debt was fully retired on July 15, 2018 leaving about $1.3 billion in net debt obligations fairly evenly split between the Development Finance Authority, largely for projects related to the state's system of higher education and largely supported by tuition and campus fees, and the Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority, for capital projects related to various state agencies. As of Fitch's 2017 State Pension Update, the combined liability burden is a low 3.7% of 2016 personal income, based on Fitch's revised 6% investment return assumption for pension plans; this is well below the 6% 50-state median. Using more recent liability data and 2017 personal income, Fitch estimates an adjusted long-term liability burden of approximately 4.1%. The state's OPEB obligations are modest. The state's major pension systems, covering state employees (PERS), teachers (TRS) and other retirees, have improved their funded status in recent years due in part to overfunding state contributions from allocations of specific tax receipts into various systems. State contributions remain a small percentage of overall state spending. PERS reported a 94% ratio of assets to liabilities as of fiscal 2017 while TRS reported a 69% ratio. Using Fitch's more conservative 6% discount rate (versus the 7.25% and 7.5% rates used, respectively, by the systems for accounting valuations) would lower the ratio of assets to liabilities to 85% and 59%, respectively. Operating Performance Oklahoma's ability to respond to cyclical downturns rests with its strong budget flexibility. While the state fared better than the nation through the Great Recession, operating revenues, nevertheless experienced two years of significant declines. To achieve budgetary balance, the state reduced expenditures and applied balances in its RDF, a similar approach the state took in closing the significant budget gaps subsequently created by the extensive softening in the oil and natural gas industries and the PIT rate cut enacted prior to the 2014 fall in resource prices. The state's reliance on spending cuts, one-time actions and reserve draw-downs to achieve balance in downturns partially reflects the restrictions on revenue expansions noted above, which limits the state's practical ability to use this tool. Financial operations are supported by largely conservative fiscal policies, including a provision in the state constitution that limits appropriations to 95% of anticipated revenues in the forthcoming fiscal year. The state closely tracks revenue collections during the year and forecasts are updated three times each fiscal year. The office of management and enterprise services' (OMES) monthly revenue monitoring and forecast updates by the Board of Equalization (BOE) are important tools that the state applies to ensure budgetary balance. Additionally, state agency spending is overseen by the state's secretary of finance and administration who is granted the authority to enact across-the-board agency reductions should revenues fall below expectations. In 2016, the legislature enhanced the state's reserve capabilities through the creation of a new Revenue Stabilization Fund (RSF) that will receive a portion of oil and gas production taxes and the corporate income tax (CIT) once tax revenues return to fiscal 2015 levels and when receipts are above a five-year average. The 2018 legislature increased the minimum revenues to be received in the GRF before a required deposit to the RSF is triggered from $5.7 billion to $6.6 billion, delaying the allocation of funds to the RSF. The state believes this new threshold may be reached in fiscal 2020. In the event that a revenue failure is declared, the state has the option of spending moneys from the fund in support of operations. The 2018 legislature also placed on the November statewide ballot a question that with majority voter support would constitutionally direct the first 5% of gross production taxes on oil and gas in each fiscal year to a new Oklahoma Vision Fund, effective July 1, 2020. Dedicated deposits of the gross production tax would then increase by 0.2% in each future fiscal year. The state would be permitted to deposit an average 4% of the principal amount of the fund into the GRF each fiscal year, effectively creating a non-operating source of income to the GRF over time. Fitch recognizes the state's intent to reduce revenue volatility in the GRF and notes that adequate funding of reserves is critical to maintaining balance as Oklahoma's volatile natural resource industry has an oversized impact on the economy and financial operations. The state's steady recovery following the Great Recession, largely tied to vibrant growth in the oil and natural gas industries, allowed the state to rebuild its RDF to $577 million (10%) of GRF revenues in fiscal 2012. The enactment of a two-step PIT rate cut in 2014, with the first reduction taking effect in 2016, did not consider the potential for a significant energy sector retrenchment that would slash the state's operating revenues. These factors contributed to very large structural budget gaps identified in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018 and led to consecutive draws from the RDF. Fitch believes the continued appropriations from the RDF highlighted the difficulty in achieving structural solutions to imbalances created by both revenue weakness as well as the significant use of non-recurring actions. The state estimates that 64% ($579 million) of $900 million in new revenues applied to solve the budget gap in fiscal 2018 were non-recurring in nature. The RDF balance at the close of fiscal 2017 was $93 million or 1.9% of GRF revenues following an appropriation of $147 million to fund supplemental appropriations for fiscal 2017 as well as reduce a forecast budget gap for fiscal 2018. A mid-year appropriation of $23.3 million from the RDF to help close a $215 million gap in the $6.8 billion fiscal 2018 budget further weakened the state's resiliency; however, revenue growth above forecast in fiscal 2018 resulted in a $381.6 million deposit, boosting the RDF to 7.7% of fiscal 2018 GRF revenues. The enacted $7.5 billion fiscal 2019 budget is an 11% increase above fiscal 2018, incorporating additional funds to state agencies, teacher and state employee salary increases and a boost in education funding. The teacher salary increase accounts for 72% of the increased K-12 education appropriation and came in advance of a strike by teachers and other school personnel. Measures to fund the increased appropriations include increases in several taxes including the gross production, cigarette, and motor vehicle taxes in addition to several revisions to other revenue sources. These tax measures, which differ from the enactment of fee and tax credit adjustments in prior fiscal years, were the first passed by the state legislature since the supermajority requirement was imposed in 1992 and reflect the challenge of constraining expense through a period of prolonged revenue weakness. Reported one-time actions in support of the budget total a modest $69 million, down significantly from recent fiscal years.

"    * GDP expands by quarterly 1.0 pct in Q3     * Annual growth pace picks up to 2.2 pct     * Consumer spending, rise in inventories main drivers   (Adds economist, details)     By George Georgiopoulos     ATHENS, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Greece's economy expanded for a ninth straight quarter in July-to-September and at a faster pace than the previous quarter, mainly driven by stronger consumer spending, government data showed on Tuesday.     Gross domestic product grew by 1.0 percent in the third quarter compared to an upwardly revised 0.4 percent in April-to-June, according to the seasonally adjusted data from statistics agency ELSTAT.      With Greece officially emerged from bailouts since late August, the data showed its recovery remains on track after a lengthy recession that shrank its economy by a quarter.     On an annual basis, Greece's economic expansion accelerated to 2.2 percent in the third quarter from a downwardly revised 1.7 percent in the second quarter.     ""The pick up in growth year-on-year was driven by stronger private consumption and a rise in inventories, helping to offset a significant drop in gross fixed capital formation which was amplified by an adverse base effect,"" said National Bank economist Nikos Magginas.     That GDP component was upwardly revised to 26 percent in the third quarter of 2017 from a previous 8.3 percent decline.     ""Exports continued their upward course but imports rose at a faster pace reflecting the strengthening of domestic demand,"" Magginas added.     The data showed that on an annual basis, net exports made a negative contribution to overall economic growth. Exports grew  7.6 percent, trailing a 15 percent rise in imports.      Based on next year's budget draft, Greece projects 2.1 percent growth in 2018, accelerating to 2.5 percent next year.     ""The third quarter growth figure is in line with official forecasts for this year as a whole,"" Magginas said.       ************************************************************* KEY FIGURES      Q3 2018  Q2 2018   Q1 2018   Q4 2017   Q3 2017 GDP (q/q, pct)     1.0      0.4*      0.5*      0.2       0.5 GDP (y/y, pct)     2.2      1.7*      2.5       2.1*      2.0* ------------------------------------------------------------- * revised source: ELSTAT   (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)   ",UPDATE 1-Greek economic growth accelerates in third quarter on stronger consumer spending,"greece's economy expanded for a ninth straight quarter in july-to-september. annual growth pace picks up to 2.2 pct. consumer spending , rise in inventories main drivers.","update 1-greek economy grows for 9th straight quarter in q3 , driven by consumer spending"

"* First round of output cuts announced on May 6 * New round equivalent to 1-1.5 mln tonnes annualised output * ArcelorMittal has forecast contracting European steeldemand(Adds shares, analyst view) By Philip Blenkinsop BRUSSELS, May 29 (Reuters) - ArcelorMittalunderlined the problems facing the European steel industry whenit cut production for the second time this month, blaming weakdemand and high imports. Shares in the company, the world's largest steelmaker, fell6% to touch their lowest point since July 2016 and were down3.7% by 0930 GMT on Wednesday. They have lost around a quarterof their value in the year to date. The cuts come after British Steel collapsed into liquidationlast week, putting 25,000 jobs at risk unless it finds a buyer. The European Commission is currently reviewing its""safeguard"" measures to limit incoming steel and prevent a surgeof imports as a result of increased tariffs effectively closingthe U.S. market. ArcelorMittal said its latest cuts amounted to annualisedoutput of 1-1.5 million tonnes. It follows cuts equivalent toannualised production of 3 million tonnes announced on May 6. Broker Jefferies said ArcelorMittal was taking the lead, asthe largest steelmaker in Europe, which was necessary in themedium-term. It added that the large market for hot-rolled coil steelappeared to have bottomed out, with other European mills cuttingoutput to allow price rises. Such steel, heat processed intometal sheets, is used for car bodies and household appliances. The company led by Lakshmi Mittal said it would reduceprimary steel production at its facilities in Dunkirk, Franceand Eisenhuettenstadt, Germany. It would also cut steel output at its plant in Bremen,Germany, in the fourth quarter of the year, extending a plannedblast furnace stoppage for repairs, and extend a similarscheduled stoppage in the final quarter in Asturias, Spain. ArcelorMittal temporarily idled production at its facilityin Krakow, Poland at the start of May when it also reducedoutput in Asturias, and slowed down a planned increase ofshipments from Italy. Geert van Poelvoorde, the head of the flat products divisionof ArcelorMittal in Europe, said the production cuts would bereversed when market conditions improve. The company cut its forecast for demand in Europe in May,predicting a contraction due to weak manufacturing and decliningautomotive production, for which steel is a major input. ArcelorMittal has steelmaking plants in 18 countriesworldwide, with 47 percent of its steel produced in Europe.(Reporting by Philip BlenkinsopEditing by Mark Potter/Keith Weir)",UPDATE 1-ArcelorMittal takes the knife to European steel output again,"arcelormittal cuts production for the second time this month, blaming weakdemand and high imports. shares in the company fell6 % to touch their lowest point since july 2016 and were down3.7 % by 0930 gmt on wed wednesday. cuts come after british steel collapsed into liquidation last week, putting 25,000 jobs at risk unless it finds a buyer.","update 2-arcelormittal cuts european steel output for second time this month , shares fall"
"(Adds details, background) LISBON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Portugal's president on Tuesday invited caretaker Prime Minister Antonio Costa to form a new government after his centre-left Socialists won Sunday's election, expanding their parliamentary representation but landing just shy of a full majority. After meeting the leaders of all parties in the new parliament one by one throughout the day and ""taking into account the election results"", President Marcelo Rebelo de Souza said in a statement that Costa was now the premier-designate. On Wednesday, Costa will open talks with his minority government's far-left allies in the previous legislature, the Communists and Left Bloc, on a potential renewal of their deal, the Socialist Party said. He also intends to negotiate with the environmentalist People-Animals-Nature party, which won four seats, and the left-wing newcomer Livre, which has one lawmaker. However, Costa and other leftist leaders have not ruled out foregoing long-term commitments, meaning the government would have to negotiate support on a case-by-case basis. Although more risky, such an option would leave Costa free also to negotiate in the future with the opposition centre-right whose stance on the need for fiscal discipline and debt reduction is similar to his own. Left Bloc leader Catarina Martins said earlier she was ready to ""negotiate solutions for the duration of the legislature"", whereas Communist leader Jeronimo de Souza said his party wanted to ""preserve its strategic independence"" rather than agree a long-term deal. With at least 106 Socialist seats in the 230-strong house, Costa needs the support of just one of his partners in the previous legislature, where his party had 86 seats, to have a working majority needed to pass laws. Costa can now name his cabinet ministers, but it is up to lawmakers to decide on the new government's programme, which must be presented within 10 days. If parliament decides to vote on it and it is rejected, the government could collapse. Analysts, however, do not expect any major obstacles for the Socialist government to be allowed to rule. Next year's budget is likely to prove its first big test, with the far-left demanding more public spending, while Costa insists on sticking to strict expenditure controls to achieve a budget surplus next year.

"By Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is reviewing ways to clamp down on the export of U.S. technology that China's government could use in its surveillance and internment of minority Muslims, amid reports of mass detentions of ethnic Uighurs and others in the Xinjiang region. In a letter to the leaders of a congressional committee, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said his department, in consultation with the State Department and other agencies, could announce export policy changes within weeks. ""We are conducting this review expeditiously and expect to publish amendments to the EAR (Export Administration Regulations) later this fall,"" Ross said in the letter to Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Chris Smith. Ross said the review included assessing whether to add Chinese individuals, businesses and others to a list of entities subject to special license requirements, revising licensing policy and updating technologies controlled for the protection of human rights. Any sanctions decision would be a rare move on human rights grounds by President Donald Trump's administration against China, with which it is engaged in a trade war while also seeking Beijing's help to resolve a standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons. Rubio and Smith, the Republican leaders of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, wrote to Ross in September urging the administration to broaden sanctions on China over its treatment of minority Muslims. Ross' letter was a response to that letter. The State Department expressed deep concern last month over China's ""worsening crackdown"" in the Xinjiang region, as officials considered sanctions against Chinese senior officials and companies linked to allegations of human rights abuses. China has called for other nations to respect its sovereignty, saying Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions.

"* Africa facing biggest economic contraction on record this year * Recovery could begin in second half of 2020 * Downturn will mean lost growth for years to come By Joe Bavier JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Reuters) - Africa is expected to reverse an economic contraction linked to fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic next year, according to the International Monetary Fund, but the impact will be felt for years to come. Sub-Saharan Africa's gross domestic product is on track to shrink this year by 1.6% - the lowest level on record - because of the combined effects of the disease and plummeting oil and commodities prices. Growth of around 4% should follow in 2021, according to the IMF's regional economic outlook for Africa, released on Wednesday. But the IMF warned that firm forecasts are currently hard to make. And in the event of a more protracted disease outbreak and deeper global recession, it envisions Africa's economy shrinking an additional 2.5% this year. ""I don't think we've ever had as difficult a time trying to do projections in the institution, certainly in my 25 years,"" Abebe Aemro Selassie, head of the IMF's Africa department, told Reuters in an interview. The Fund's baseline scenario assumes that measures aimed at containing the disease, including lockdowns, will be concentrated in this year's second quarter. ""We hope to see a rebound after that, with some recovery into next year. In some sectors such as construction or services, there will be pent-up demand and there could be a bounce back in those sectors,"" Selassie said. Still, the pandemic will cause persistent, large losses of output ""with the level of real per capita GDP expected to be about 4.5% lower by 2024 compared with the pre-COVID-19 projections,"" the report stated. African oil exporters can expect a 2.8% contraction this year, according to the IMF report. Other resource-intensive economies will shrink 2.7%. Non-resource-intensive countries are expected to see growth decline to 2.0% from 6.2% last year. Within this group, however, tourism-dependent countries, including Cape Verde, Comoros, Gambia, Mauritius, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Seychelles, are projected to see a 5.1% contraction. To give countries breathing room during the crisis, the IMF and World Bank have proposed suspending debt service this year for the world's poorest countries. Wealthy nations are expected to answer the call during a meeting of the Group of 20 (G20) major economies on Wednesday. The IMF is not at this stage endorsing the kind of broader relief and debt cancellation African finance ministers are calling for. ""Debt sustainability is country-specific and a medium- to long-term issue. Much will depend on how countries recover from this shock. My sense is they will do so at varied speeds,"" Selassie said. Africa's creditor landscape has grown increasingly complex over the past two decades. Debt is held not only by Paris Club members and multilaterals, but also China, commercial banks and Eurobond holders. ""Quite a lot of thinking and work is needed to make sure that we understand and have modalities through which we can do debt relief operations,"" he said. ""That's really been kick-started with a vengeance as a result of the challenges countries are facing right now ... a new architecture is needed.""

Investor sentiment has brightened this week after the world's top two economies took the first step in calling a truce to their 18-month tariff dispute by sealing a Phase 1 trade deal. Spurring gains in global stocks for a fifth day, data showed China ended 2019 on a somewhat firmer note, even as economic growth cooled to its weakest in nearly 30 years in the last year. U.S. data showed homebuilding surged to a 13-year high in December, suggesting the housing market recovery was back on track amid low mortgage rates. ""There's a lot of enthusiasm out there and it is a combination of earnings and strong data that is supporting the market,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. The three main stock indexes closed at record highs on Thursday, with the S&P 500 surging past the 3,300-mark for the first time, boosted by a rally in technology stocks and strong retail sales data. At 9:57 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.12% to 29,333.87. The S&P 500 was up 0.20% at 3,323.29 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.16% to 9,371.90. ""From a technical viewpoint, the market is a bit overbought and there is a possibility that the rally is going to exhaust itself at one point,"" said Cardillo. After an upbeat showing from banks earlier this week, oilfield service provider Schlumberger NV reported a slightly better-than-expected quarterly profit, sending its shares up 2.1%. Analysts expect profits at S&P 500 companies to have dropped 0.8% in the fourth quarter, but call for 5.8% growth in the first quarter of 2020, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Google-parent Alphabet Inc rose 1%, extending gains after it became the fourth U.S. company to top a market value of more than $1 trillion on Thursday. The Dow Jones Transports index fell 0.5% after disappointing earnings updates from J B Hunt Transport Services Inc, Kansas City Southern and CSX Corp. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.37-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.26-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

"(Adds cash flow outlook, background, shares) Feb 26 (Reuters) - Continental Resources Inc on Wednesday forecast lower-than-expected free cash flow for the year despite keeping capital spending flat, sending shares of the shale producer down 17% in after-market trading. The weak outlook comes as energy investors have been pressuring companies to cut back spending and instead shore up cash for dividends and share buybacks. The oil and gas producer also forecast 2020 production to grow between 4% and 6%, or compound annual production growth rate of 10%, below the company's five-year vision target of 12.5% growth per year. Investors shrugged off a 2 cents beat on adjusted quarterly profit as a 12.8% surge in production helped offset lower prices for natural gas. The results were the last under legendary U.S. oilman Harold Hamm who stepped down as Continental's chief executive officer at the end of last year to become its executive chairman. Hamm, who owns 77% of Continental, was replaced by William Berry, a former ConocoPhillips executive and Continental board member. Continental forecast free cash flow between $350 million and $400 million for 2020, below analysts' average estimate of $500.9 million, according to Refinitiv IBES estimates. The outlook was based on $55 per barrel price estimate for U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude, while U.S. oil futures were trading below $49 a barrel on Wednesday. For a $5 per barrel drop below the estimate, Continental said free cash flow would drop by $300 million. Continental, which operates in the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana as well as the STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma, said full-year oil production would range between 198,000 and 201,000 barrels per day. It plans to spend $2.65 billion in 2020. Fourth-quarter production rose 12.8% to 365,341 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), while average net sales prices fell 9.8% to $33.49 per barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Net income attributable to the company fell to $193.9 million in the three months ended Dec. 31 from $197.7 million a year earlier. On a per share basis, profit remained flat at 53 cents. Adjusted quarterly profit of 55 cents per share beat analysts' average estimate of 53 cents per share. Total revenue rose 4% to $1.2 billion, slightly higher than expectations of $1.14 billion.

"* Auto sector second worst performer on the board * Japan Display soars on news it will get financial aid By Ayai Tomisawa TOKYO, May 31 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei tumbled to a morethan three-month low, led by a plunge in carmakers after U.S.President Donald Trump said the United States would impose a newtariff on all imports from Mexico next month until illegalimmigration is stopped.

Trump said on Thursday the U.S. will impose a 5% tariff onall goods coming from Mexico starting on June 10 until illegalimmigration across the southern border is stopped. ""The Tariff will gradually increase until the IllegalImmigration problem is remedied, at which time the Tariffs willbe removed,"" Trump said on Twitter. In a statement issued by the White House, Trump said thetariff would increase to 10% on July 1, 15% on Aug. 1, 20% onSept. 1 and to 25% on Oct. 1. ""It doesn't look like there are prospects of resolving theimmigration issue by the deadline.

""The immigration issue itself is contained between the U.S.and Mexico, but Trump's latest move reminded investors about hishardline stance on trade issues so the market is cautious abouta trade deal between the U.S. and Japan as well.""

"By Paulina Duran and Byron Kaye SYDNEY, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Australia's top financial regulators have called for tougher powers to police poor conduct in the country's A$2 trillion ($1.44 trillion) retirement funds market, the world's fourth largest, showed documents published by a powerful inquiry on Monday. In submissions to a government-mandated inquiry that has criticised regulators for failures in policing the financial services sector, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) called for extra powers to enforce compliance with laws requiring companies to act in the best interests of savers. The year-long inquiry, which is expected to recommend far-reaching reforms, has unearthed widespread misconduct including charging fees to the estates of dead people, fee gouging and breaching laws by failing to act in customers' best interests. Yet, in their submissions to the Royal Commission, APRA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) rejected criticism by the inquiry that they were too soft. ""APRA does not accept the premise that it has not generally acted promptly on misconduct or potential misconduct,"" the regulator said in its submission. ""However, there are steps that could be taken to improve the ability of both APRA and ASIC to take prompt and effective action in cases of misconduct,"" it said. The regulator accepted it could make better use of its current ability to sue firms that breach the law, and called for more powers. ""There is also a need to strengthen APRA's powers in some areas (including to regulate and enforce the best interests of members covenant and sole purpose test),"" it said. VERTICAL INTEGRATION ASIC called for more regulatory intervention to manage conflicts of interest in vertically integrated financial firms such as Australia's largest-listed wealth manager, AMP Ltd , and rival IOOF Holdings Ltd, including a potential outright-ban. Vertically integrated financial firms have units that create financial products while at the same time owning businesses that buy those products on behalf of customers. ""ASIC believes that legislative intervention is warranted to address the inherent conflict issues"" of firms which operate on behalf of both shareholders and policy holders, the regulator said. ""Consideration should be given to prohibiting"" dual-responsibility entities, it said, referring specifically to firms that create the products in which its pension units invest. Such a move would also impact some of the country's largest lenders, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) and Westpac Banking Corp, which also have vertically-integrated units that create conflicts of interest. Foreseeing the higher regulatory scrutiny, CBA and NAB are in the process offloading their retirement units, while Westpac has said it remains committed to its investment in its pension business. ""Nonetheless it is ASIC's view, given the evidence ... regarding conflicted structures and the inability of (superannuation entities) to manage these in the best interests of members, that more stringent measures are required,"" the regulator said. Australia's biggest retirement savings manager, AMP, said customers have benefited from vertical integration and competition should minimise any conflicts between parties. A forced breakup ""would also introduce new (albeit different) costs into the system that would have to be borne by someone and a new set of risks that would need to be managed/mitigated,"" AMP said in its submission.

"    * Indonesia leads fall, down over 3%     * Vietnam up for sixth session     By Arundhati Dutta     April 8 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets closed lower on Wednesday as a mounting death toll from the global coronavirus outbreak  prompted investors to book profits after sharp gains earlier this week.

PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk and PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk both fell 7%.

The dollar index, which measures the greenbackagainst six currencies, rose 0.47% to 97.74, its highest sinceJune 2017. The euro fell 0.52% against the dollar, slippingbelow the $1.12 handle for the first time in nearly three weeks. The dollar was supported by data on Tuesday that showedsales of new U.S. single-family homes jumped to a near1-1/2-year high in March. The data follows recentpositive news on retail sales and exports which have easedconcerns of a sharply slowing U.S. economy, analysts said. ""Today is certainly a good dollar day,"" said Minh Trang,senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara,California. ""The dollar is coming in full force and we have seensomewhat of a lower trend on the euro overall,"" he said. Friday's U.S. GDP data for the first quarter couldstrengthen the case that while the current period of globalexpansion is in its late stages, the United States is yet to runout of steam. ""We are in a very range-bound market with the broaderpicture being more positive for the dollar relative to the euroafter the weak eurozone PMI manufacturing data last week,"" saidUlrich Leuchtmann, head of FX strategy at Commerzbank. An uptick this week in oil prices on news of U.S. plans totighten a clamp down on Iranian oil exports from next month isalso a positive for the dollar, said Silicon Valley Bank'sTrang. ""If we do see a follow-through from higher oil prices to alittle bit higher inflation I think you will see the Fed be in aposition to be more stable with maintaining rates andeliminating any kind of conversation about rate cuts,"" he said. With the U.S. Federal Reserve on pause with interest ratehikes there has been some talk that the Fed will need to cutrates before long. Sterling slid to a two-month low on Tuesday as hopes for abreakthrough in Brexit talks between the ruling and oppositionparties faded and British Prime Minister Theresa May facedgrowing pressure to quit.

"* Euro zone periphery govt bond yields http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Rejigs to reflect slight movement in prices) By Olga Cotaga LONDON, April 1 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields held near recent lows on Wednesday, with investors holding on to safe-haven government debt as the continuing spread of the novel coronavirus fed risk-off sentiment. More than 74,000 new cases of the coronavirus were reported globally on Tuesday, the largest increase in a single day since the virus began and almost 30% above the previous day's rise. More than 850,000 cases and 42,000 deaths have been reported across 205 countries and territories, according to a Reuters tally on Wednesday. Italy and the United States have reported a total of more than 100,000 cases each. Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield closed slightly down at -0.46%. Most of the rest of the core euro area market also hovered near recent lows, with France and Belgium seeing rates steady., ""I think it's a great opportunity to get into the European bond market as you have a guarantee from the (European) Central Bank"" that it will continue buying government bonds amid its hefty stimulus package, said Marija Veitmane, multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets. ""By expanding the QE (quantitative easing program), the ECB are there to support the peripheral European markets,"" she said. Portugal sold seven-year bonds on Wednesday via a syndicate of banks, as national treasurers in Europe come under pressure to finance government rescue programs being mounted to fight an economic downturn caused by the spread of COVID-19. By mid-morning, the order book had reached 24 billion euros. Portugal's 10-year government bond yield was last up 3 basis point at 0.86%, having reached earlier a six-day high of 0.871 . Spain was the first euro zone member country to tap the primary market with a seven-year bond last week. And Belgium saw record demand for its bond sale on Tuesday. Investors placed orders of over 58 billion euros for Belgium's 8 billion-euro sale of seven-year bonds, according to a lead manager update seen by Reuters, making it the largest-ever order book for a euro zone bond sale. Lyn Graham-Taylor, fixed income strategist at Rabobank, said there was a strong risk-off mood across the financial markets on Wednesday. The market can't ""look around the corner"" for a significant improvement in the euro zone economy given recently weak data and the lack of encouraging news about the coronavirus, he said. Data on Wednesday showed euro zone manufacturing activity collapsed last month as breaks in global supply chains caused by measures to curb coronavirus crushed output. The nosedive could worsen in coming months, a survey showed on Wednesday.

"MELBOURNE, Jan 16 (Reuters) - World number one Ash Barty maintained her mastery over Marketa Vondrousova but Aryna Sabalenka jolted Simona Halep's Australian Open build-up in the quarter-finals of the Adelaide International on Thursday. In a rematch of last year's French Open final, Barty prevailed once again, winning 6-3 6-3 for a 4-0 head-to-head lead over the Czech. American Danielle Collins, who knocked out fourth seeded Belinda Bencic 6-3 6-1, awaits the Australian in the semi-finals. Barty fired 20 winners and saved six of the seven break points to clinch the contest against Vondrousova, who was playing her first tournament since Wimbledon following wrist surgery. Barty will take on Ukraine's Lesia Tsurenko in the first round of the Australian Open where she will bid to end the host nation's long wait for a home-grown champion at the year's first Grand Slam. Earlier, Belarusian Sabalenka stunned reigning Wimbledon champion Halep 6-4 6-2 to set up a semi-final clash with Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska, who beat Donna Vekic 6-4 6-3. Level at 4-4 in the first set, Sabalenka reeled off seven straight games to race to a 6-4 5-0 lead before wrapping up victory in a little over an hour. ""I knew she'll fight until the end -- it doesn't matter what the score,"" she said after registering her first win against the Romanian former world number one. ""When the score was 5-0, I kind of expected that she'll try to do everything she can to come back in the match."" Sabalenka narrowly averted a first round exit against Hsieh Su-Wei and had to toil against American qualifier Bernarda Pera in the next match.

"By Will Boggs MD NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Higher intake of gluten early inlife is associated with an increased risk of celiac disease (CD)and CD autoimmunity, according to new findings. ""We found that 1-year-olds in the highest third of glutenintake had a two-fold increased relative risk of developingceliac disease autoimmunity (CDA), a potential prodromal stageof celiac disease,"" said Dr. Karl Marild from the NorwegianInstitute of Public Health, in Oslo, Norway, and Queen SilviaChildren's Hospital, in Gothenburg, Sweden. ""For me, it was a surprising to find this magnitude ofassociation given the ubiquitous nature of gluten in our diet,""he told Reuters Health by email. Gluten intake drives the pathology associated with celiacdisease, but it remains unclear whether the amount of glutenintake predicts later CD or CDA. To investigate, Dr. Marild's team used data from 1,875participants in the prospective Diabetes Autoimmunity Study inthe Young (DAISY). Compared with 1-year-olds in the lowest thirdof gluten intake, those in the highest third had a 96% increasedrisk of CD (P=0.09) and a significant 2.17-fold increased riskof CDA. The association between gluten intake in 1-year-olds andfuture CDA and CD did not differ by the child's HLA genotype orfamily history of CD, the researchers report in The AmericanJournal of Gastroenterology, online May 9. The incidence of CD increased with the cumulative glutenintake throughout childhood (corresponding to a 15% increase inrisk per standard deviation of cumulative gluten intake by age6, P=0.04), whereas the cumulative gluten intake throughoutchildhood was not associated with CDA risk. ""While the strength of association was similar for theoutcome celiac disease and celiac disease autoimmunity, only thelatter reached statistical significance (possibly related to thefact that this outcome was more prevalent),"" Dr. Marild said.""However, if our findings are corroborated, they may provide asomewhat better understanding on one significant aspect of thelikely multifactorial etiology of this disease."" ""It is important to stress that we do not recommend a changein pediatric feeding practices,"" he said. ""Because this is anobservational study, there are many possible explanations to ourfindings, including non-causal explanations related to bias."" ""Our conclusions are subject to the caveat that this studywas restricted to genetically at-risk children from Denver,U.S.,"" Dr. Marild cautioned. ""We do not know the extent to whichthese results can be generalized to other populations. Previousdata in this field of research are relatively scarce and haveyielded inconsistent results.""

"By Lisa Rapaport (Reuters Health) - White mothers may receive more pain assessments after delivery and have better access to painkillers than women from other racial and ethnic groups, two new studies suggest. For one study, researchers examined data on postpartum pain scores and pain management for 9,900 women. When women rated their pain on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the worst, Hispanic women were 61% more likely to report scores of 5 or higher and black women were more than twice as likely to report high pain scores, this study found. Despite reporting higher pain scores, black and Hispanic women received significantly fewer morphine milligram equivalents (a measurement of opioids) than white women and were significantly less likely to receive a prescription for an opioid when they went home after giving birth. ""Our study shows black and Hispanic women experience disparities in pain management in the postpartum setting,"" said study leader Dr. Nevert Badreldin from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. ""These disparities cannot be explained by less perceived pain,"" Badreldin said in a statement. Just 4.2% of white women reported pain scores of 5 or higher, compared with 7.7% of Hispanic women and 11.8% of black women, researchers report in Obstetrics & Gynecology. However, half of the white mothers received at least 24.8 morphine milligram equivalents a day of pain relief. By contrast, half of Hispanic women received no more than 19.4 morphine milligram equivalents a day, and half of black women received no more than 23.5 morphine milligram equivalents a day. And almost 47% of white mothers received opioid prescriptions when they were discharged from the hospital, compared with 39% of Hispanic mothers and 45% of black mothers. Following delivery, women commonly use pain medication to manage pain associated with cramping, vaginal lacerations, and surgical and musculoskeletal pain. A second study in the same journal examined how often 1,701 mothers got pain assessments after delivery and what scores they reported. In this study, 28% of black mothers reported pain scores of at least 7 out of 10, compared with 22% of Hispanic women, 20% of white mothers, and 15% of Asian women. Over the first 24 hours after birth, white women were asked about their pain levels an average of 10.2 times, compared with 8.4 to 9.5 assessments for other mothers.

"(Fixes reference to Lopez Obrador's surname in headline) By Ana Isabel Martinez MEXICO CITY, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Mexican state oil firm Pemexwill make all its debt payments, President Andres Manuel LopezObrador said on Thursday, promising to shore up its financesafter Moody's and Fitch downgraded the firm's credit rating toone notch above junk. Lopez Obrador, a veteran leftist who took office inDecember, said he would present a plan on Friday to strengthenPemex's finances.

""We will pay all of the obligationspunctually."" The plan to help Pemex's finances is expected to include areduction in the taxes the company pays to the government and acapital injection. Lopez Obrador, 65, stressed that the government would nottake on additional debt to help Pemex. ""We will not resort to debt,"" he said. ""We will have noproblems resolving our obligations."" The company said in a presentation viewed by Reuters that itexpects to receive a capital infusion of at least $1.25 billionbefore the year's end. Obrador's administration has previously spoken of reducingthe Pemex tax burden to free up the firm to invest more inexploration and production. Rating agency Fitch downgraded Pemex's credit rating in lateJanuary, citing the company's high leverage and tax burden.Pemex holds roughly $103 billion in financial debt, the highestof any state oil firm in Latin America. Fitch rated Pemex's long-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs)for foreign and local currency at BBB-, the lowestinvestment-grade rating.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Hong Kong/Shanghai-March 19: The ratings on Chinese city-districtdeveloper China Fortune Land Development Co., Ltd. (CFLD, BB+/Stable) and allits Fitch-rated US dollar senior notes will not be changed by the adoption ofproposed amendments to the notes' indenture, says Fitch Ratings. The company announced 4 March 2019 it is soliciting the consent of bondholdersfor the changes. The proposed amendments aim to align the change of controlprovision in all series of its securities with that of CFLD's USD530 million8.625% senior notes due 2021 issued on 28 February 2019. The proposedamendments, if adopted, will provide CFLD with more equity funding flexibilityto introduce strategic or financial investors to support its diversificationbeyond the pan-Beijing region.  Fitch does not expect to change its view on CFLD solely on the adoption of theproposed amendments. However, CFLD's ratings may come under pressure ifits leverage remains higher than Fitch's expectation due to weaker cashcollection from the government than prior years, although this may be partlydriven by temporary factors. The agency estimates that CFLD's leverage, measuredby net debt/district-related inventory, increased to above 75% by end-September2018. We may consider negative rating action if we think the leverage will besustained above 50%.  Major proposed amendments to the indenture include: - removing the provision that constitutes a trigger of the change of controlprovision when controlling persons cease to own 35% of voting power; - adding ""rating decline"" as a ""double trigger"" necessary to trigger the changeof control mechanism.

"* FCC last month voted to designate Huawei a security risk * Huawei says move ""based on politics, not security"" * Says move threatens improving connectivity in rural America (Updates with new headline) By David Kirton SHENZHEN, China, Dec 5 (Reuters) - China's Huawei has mounted a legal challenge against the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) after the body designated the technology giant as a security threat and moved to bar it from a government subsidy program. The FCC last month voted unanimously to designate Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and peer ZTE Corp as national security risks, barring their U.S. rural carrier customers from tapping an $8.5 billion government fund to purchase Huawei or ZTE telecommunications equipment. Huawei said on Thursday it filed a petition with the Fifth Circuit Court in New Orleans challenging the FCC decision. The FCC argued the companies' ties to China's government and military apparatus, and Chinese laws requiring that such companies assist the Chinese government with intelligence activities, pose a U.S. national security risk. It also voted to propose requiring carriers remove and replace equipment from Huawei and ZTE in existing networks. ""Banning a company like Huawei, just because we started in China - this does not solve cyber security challenges,"" Huawei's Chief Legal Officer Song Liuping said at a news conference at the firm's headquarters in Shenzhen. He said the FCC has not provided evidence to show Huawei is a security threat and that ""this decision, just like the entity list in May, is based on politics, not security."" The Huawei document was not yet available in the U.S. court filing system. It is not clear when the FCC decision will come into effect. FCC spokesman Brian Hart declined to comment. On Wednesday, the body's chairman said he will propose $9 billion in funding over the next decade to boost fifth-generation (5G) wireless telecommunications coverage in rural U.S. areas. U.S. President Trump in May placed Huawei on the country's trade blacklist, citing national security concerns, which banned companies from supplying Huawei with U.S. components without special licenses. The move came after Washington brought criminal charges against Huawei, alleging theft of trade secrets, bank fraud and violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran. It has also sought to convince allies to ban it from the 5G networks over spying fears - increasing tension with Beijing amid a tit-for-tat trade war. The United States is now considering means of stopping more foreign shipments of products with U.S. technology to Huawei, Reuters reported last week. Karl Song, vice president of Huawei's corporate communications department, said the FCC rule threatened improving connectivity in rural America, and would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and even force some small carriers to go bankrupt. Asked to comment on Huawei's sales to rural carriers, Song said the firm's U.S. revenue was ""minimal"" compared with the $11 billion in goods that it procured from the United States. Alan Fan, Huawei vice president of IP strategy and international legal policy, said U.S. rural carriers and groups submitted 90 comments to the FCC, 58% of which opposed action against it. The Chinese telecoms giant has also in recent days faced a public backlash at home after details of the dismissal and wrongful detention of a former employee went viral. Chinese media have also reported on at least one other similar case. Asked about the matter, Song said it was not a labour dispute and the company was obligated to report to authorities if it found any suspicious, unlawful act.

"By Michel Rose and Belén Carreño PARIS/MADRID, June 14 (Reuters) - French President EmmanuelMacron's government warned Ciudadanos, its Spanish centre-rightally in the European Parliament, on Friday of possible""consequences"" if it goes ahead with local alliances withfar-right movement Vox in Spain. Ciudadanos, Spain's third-biggest party after nationalelections in April, agreed at the weekend to divide up seniorappointments in the Madrid and Murcia regional assemblies withVox and the mainstream conservative People's Party (PP), causingunease inside the party. Macron's party, Republic On the Move, and Ciudadanos areboth part of the new centrist, liberal Renew Europe group thatthey hope can play a role of kingmaker at the EuropeanParliament as parties seek alliances after last month's Europeanelections. ""At the local level, alliances with the far right, whateverthey are, are not in line with our values,"" a spokesman forFrench European Affairs Minister Amelie de Montchalin said. ""Consequences will have to be taken at the (Renew Europe)group level,"" he said. Macron has already discussed a European alliance against thefar right with Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, aSocialist. Sanchez is busy attempting to form a nationalgovernment after his party won the most votes in April but notenough for a majority in parliament. Montchalin was quoted earlier by Spanish newspaper El Paisas saying: ""An alliance with the far right at the local level,as we're seeing in Spain, is not an option."" In a brief statement, Ciudadanos said only that it wasclosely collaborating with Macron's party and expected it tocontinue to support Ciudadanos as part of the liberal camp. Itmade no reference to the French concerns as such. Vox leader Santiago Abascal took to Twitter to criticiseMacron for ""treating Spain as if it were a French province"",calling it ""a humiliating interference"". In April, the anti-immigration, ultra-conservative Voxbecame the first far-right party with a significantrepresentation in Spain's national parliament since the death ofdictator Francisco Franco in 1975. Vox had enabled the formation of a regional PP/Ciudadanosgovernment in Andalusia by offering legislative support after anelection there in December, but the weekend agreement on Madridand Murcia took that three-way alliance one stage further. In addition, the PP has reached a tentative agreement withCiudadanos to take over the Madrid city hall, where they alsoneed Vox to have a majority. Their alliances are meant to block the left from takingcontrol in either region or city.

"By David Morgan WASHINGTON, April 23 (Reuters) - Donald McGahn, the formerWhite House counsel described in the Mueller report asrepeatedly standing up to President Donald Trump, could become astar witness again if congressional Democrats get their way intheir investigation of whether Trump used his office to obstructjustice. Since the April 18 release of Special Counsel RobertMueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 electionand any ties to Republican Trump's campaign, Democrats have seenMcGahn as someone who could be as important as Mueller himself,according to a source familiar with the matter. But the Democrats are likely to face Trump's resistance. TheWashington Post reported on Tuesday that the White House plannedto oppose a subpoena by the House of Representatives JudiciaryCommittee for McGahn to testify. Mueller's 448-page partially blacked out report portrayedMcGahn as one of the few figures in Trump's orbit to challengehim when he tried to shut down the investigation that hasclouded his more than two years in the White House. ""Mr. McGahn has been touted as a man of integrity and he isa major witness in the Mueller report,"" said Sheila Jackson Lee,a member of the judiciary committee. The White House did not immediately comment on theWashington Post report, which said Trump will claim executiveprivilege, a legal doctrine allowing the president to withholdinformation about internal executive branch deliberations fromother branches of government. McGahn's attorney, William Burck, did not respond torequests for comment. Democrats are particularly interested in hearing McGahndescribe in his own words and in Congress an account in theMueller report in which McGahn refused Trump's instructions. In June 2017 Trump called McGahn to say he should tellDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to remove the specialcounsel because he had conflicts of interest, the report said. Trump also failed to get McGahn to dispute media reportsthat the president tried to fire Mueller, the report said. ""That, in itself, could be an obstruction of justice, as Mr.McGahn would be able to testify – that he was asked to do it andthen asked not to tell anyone what he’d been asked to do,"" Leesaid. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, who has subpoenaed theU.S. Department of Justice to provide the unredacted Muellerreport and underlying evidence, issued a subpoena on Monday forMcGahn to provide the committee with documents by May 7 andtestify on May 21. But it was not clear that McGahn would comply, especially ifthe White House asserts executive privilege. Nor could Democratspredict how much the former White House counsel would be willingto discuss, even if he does testify. On Tuesday evening, Nadler said, ""The moment for the WhiteHouse to assert some privilege to prevent this testimony frombeing heard has long since passed."" The House of Representatives has the sole power under theU.S. Constitution to impeach the president, and any effort wouldbe led by the judiciary panel. Mueller's report concluded that there was not enoughevidence to establish that Trump’s campaign engaged in acriminal conspiracy with Moscow. However, the report outlinedmultiple instances where Trump tried to thwart Mueller's probe. Mueller stopped short of concluding whether Trump could beprosecuted for obstruction of justice, a criminal charge thatrequires proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But such a high standard would not apply to Democrats ifthey decided to bring impeachment proceedings. In the days following the Mueller report's release, McGahncame under attack from Trump's personal attorney RudolphGiuliani who called into question the veracity of his statementsto Mueller's team of prosecutors. ""I would ask which of the three versions is McGahn standingby. There are three versions he gives of that account,"" Giulianitold CNN over the weekend. ""I'm telling you, he's confused."" A prominent elections lawyer, McGahn served as Trump'scampaign counsel before being named White House counsel inNovember 2016. He played a pivotal role in helping Trump reshape thefederal judiciary in a conservative direction and roll backregulations on a range of industries.

"* Private equity auction delayed by merger talks - sources * Deal worth up to 7 billion euros - sources * Discussions with Elanco at preliminary stage - sources * Bayer likely to retain stake in merged entity - sources By Arno Schuetze and Pamela Barbaglia FRANKFURT/LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - Bayer hasapproached U.S. drug firm Elanco Animal Health todiscuss a possible combination of their pet-health businesses tocreate an industry giant, three sources familiar with the mattertold Reuters. The two companies are working with banks to ensure anymerger would secure regulatory approval, the sources said,speaking on condition of anonymity. Bayer has delayed the launch of an auction to private equityfunds to clinch a bilateral deal with Elanco, the fourth-largestplayer in the animal health industry globally, the sources said. The German drugmaker is under pressure to raise cash andboost its share price after its $63 billion purchase ofMonsanto. Bayer ranks fifth in veterinary medicine. Aside from Elanco,its bigger rivals are former Pfizer unit Zoetis, unlistedBoehringer Ingelheim, which bought animal health assets fromSanofi, and drugmaker Merck & Co. Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann said in November hiscompany would divest several assets including its animal healthdivision, which analysts have said could fetch 6 billion to 7billion euros ($6.7 billion-$7.8 billion). The sources said discussions with Elanco were at an earlystage and Bayer remained interested in receiving bids fromprivate equity investors later this year. An auction process was initially expected to start in Junebut Bayer would only dispatch information packages toprospective bidders towards the end of the summer, they said. A Bayer spokesman said the firm was ""progressing as planned""with efforts to separate the animal health business. ""After the strategic review of the possibilities, the mainfocus is on a sale,"" he said, adding Bayer continued to""consider all value-maximising options."" He declined to commenton Elanco. Elanco, which also declined to comment on any deal, offersmore than 125 products to veterinarians and food animalproducers in more than 90 countries. The company, based in Greenfield in the U.S. state ofIndiana, has a market value of $12 billion but it might struggleto finance an outright acquisition of Bayer's unit unless theGerman drugmaker decided to retain a stake in the combinedentity, two sources said. Elanco inherited a significant amount of debt from itsprevious owner Eli Lilly, which spun it off last year. As of December, it had about $2.5 billion of overall seniordebt. In its annual report, it warned investors about the riskof failing to generate sufficient cash to service all its debts. The sources said an all-cash sale to Elanco was unlikely,adding Bayer would need to keep a stake in the merged company tosecure a deal. Private equity firms may offer an easier exit for the Germangroup but they are expected to value the company at a much lowerprice due to its declining business, the sources said. Buyout funds had tried to take control of Elanco when it waspart of Eli Lilly but the company opted for a more lucrativespin-off and listed the business in New York where it trades atabout 20 times earnings.

"    * Dovish ECB comments weigh on CEE fx, yields, impact ismild    * Zloty is stablest for decades, yields down ahead ofauction    * Leu drifts off record lows, Romanian shares fall further    By Sandor Peto    BUDAPEST, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Central European currencies andgovernment bond yields mostly eased somewhat on Friday afterdovish comments from the European Central Bank (ECB) decreasedthe likelihood of monetary tightening across the region too.    ECB President Mario Draghi's comments on Thursday expressingconcern over an economic slowdown in the euro zone reinforcedexpectations that the bank will not start to increase interestrates in the autumn, contrary to its earlier projection.    The resulting dollar buying against the euro also weighed oncurrencies in the European Union's eastern states, whose maintrade partner is the euro zone.    The region's assets have been shielded by faster growth thanin western Europe, and in the case of Poland - the largesteastern EU member by far - a stable monetary policy.    The Polish central bank (NBP) has kept its main interestrate at a record low 1.5 percent since 2015 and its governor,Adam Glapinski, said earlier this month it could stay unchangeduntil 2022.      A rise in Polish interest rates is now less likely than afew months ago due to a lower inflation outlook, rate-setterLukasz Hardt said on Friday.    The Polish zloty started to ease even beforeHardt's comments.    It shed 0.2 percent by 0957 GMT, to trade at 4.2935.    That level is still slightly firmer than the currency's200-day moving average of 4.296.        STABILITY    The zloty has been the region's most stable currency inrecent months and its weekly volatility has been the lowest indecades.    ""The weekly range of fluctuations is the lowest since June1997,"" Santander Bank Polska analysts said in a note, addingthat it expected healthy demand at Poland's government bondauction on Friday.         The Polish and Czech 10-year government bond yields trackedsafe-haven Bunds more closely in the past months than their morevolatile Hungarian and Romanian peers.    The 10-year Polish bond traded at 2.7755 percent at 1012GMT, lower by 4 basis points from Thursday, edging towards the2-year lows set early this month at 2.71 percent.    The yield on Hungarian government bonds dropped by 1-3 basispoints from levels before the ECB's conferences, with the10-year paper trading at 2.83 percent.    ""(After the ECB's comments) it has become less credible thatthe Hungarian central bank can and will start monetarytightening in the near future,"" one Budapest-based fixed incometrader said.    Romania's leu firmed 0.3 percent as the domesticmarket reopened after a public holiday on Thursday.    But it stayed near record lows, and a 1.1 percent fall inBucharest's main stock index also reflected the factthat new taxes on the banking and energy sectors continue topressure Romanian markets.

"(Repeats Monday's column with no changes to the text. Theopinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist forReuters.) * Shanghai Tin: https://tmsnrt.rs/2FZQPeX * LME Tin Stocks and Spreads: https://tmsnrt.rs/2G0jmkt By Andy Home LONDON, July 8 (Reuters) - The tin market was last weekrudely awakened from its previous range-trading slumber. On the London Metal Exchange (LME), three-month tincollapsed 7% over the course of Tuesday to $17,585 per tonne,the lowest print since August 2016. It has since clawed its way back to a current $18,350 butlooks susceptible to further selling by technical and momentumfunds. The chart picture looks even worse in Shanghai, where thebear attack was sprung amid a build in short positioning and aspike in trading activity. Such extreme moves are not unusual in the tiny tin market,where a bit of volume can push prices a long way. It's tempting to explain the price collapse through afundamental prism of rising LME stocks and Chinese exports but,as ever with the tin market, appearances can be highlydeceptive. Indeed, rumbling supply issues may yet bite the Shanghaibears. MADE IN CHINA The Shanghai Futures Exchange tin contract is a relativenewcomer, launched in the first quarter of 2015. However, activity has been steadily building. Volumes lastyear were up by 32% and open interest by 10% on 2017 levels. And both indicators have just spiked again. Market open interest at the end of last week was 45,580contracts, the highest level since December 2018. Volumesmushroomed to 348,532 contracts, the third highest weekly totalon record. Taken together with the price break below 142,390 yuan($20,795) per tonne, the December 2017 low which has defined thebottom of a three-year trading range, all the available evidencesuggests a concerted bear attack on a technically vulnerablemarket. Where Shanghai led, London has followed. UNWINDING THE SQUEEZE Superficially, the sudden break-down of the tin price looksto be a response to rising availability. Chinese exports of refined tin jumped 79% year-on-year to4,587 tonnes in the first five months of 2019. It's the fastest rate of export since the Chinese governmentquietly got rid of a previous 10% export levy at the start of2017. However, the flow of Chinese metal hasn't happened inisolation but rather in the context of a strong gravitationalpull from the London market, which has just experienced one ofits periodic squeezes. This one was particularly acute, the spread between cash andthree-month metal flexing out to a $340 backwardation at onestage in May. Such a hefty cash premium opened the export arbitrage windowwith the Chinese market. It's quite possible that some of thatflow has found its way onto LME warrant. The backwardation has also sucked metal onto warrant fromthe shadow LME warehousing system. Since March a total 1,820 tonnes of tin have been warrantedat the U.S. port of Baltimore, an unlikely destination for anyChinese exports but an obvious one for anyone holding off-marketstocks in the country. LME stocks have rebuilt from less than 1,000 tonnes in Aprilto 6,495 tonnes, the highest they've been since June 2016. That has killed off the squeeze for now, the benchmarkcash-to-three month spread flipping back into contango at theend of last month. The key takeaway, however, is that the squeeze has triggereda redistribution of previously hidden inventory from bothChinese producers and Western financiers to the statisticallight of LME storage. The surge in LME stocks may look bearish but is in reality areaction to the prior bull play on time-spreads. SUPPLY PROBLEMS Tin's long-running supply issues, meanwhile, remainunaffected by these spread and stocks gyrations. Shipments from Indonesia, the world's largest tin exporter,slipped 2% last year and fell a harder 9% in the first half ofthis year to 35,661 tonnes. Indonesia's export flows have a history of volatility butthis year's decline is noteworthy given the country's producershad the same LME price incentive to ship stocks as those inChina. China's ability to destock further, meanwhile, is moot giventhe steady decline in the amount of tin concentrate available tothe country's smelters from mines in neighbouring Myanmar. Myanmar's production surge over the middle of the decadeupended the global tin market, opening up a new source of rawmaterials. However, that surge now appears to be spent. China's importsof tin concentrates, most of which come from Myanmar, fell 25%last year and are down again so far this year. The International Tin Association (ITA) estimates Chinaimported around 18,200 tonnes of contained tin in concentratefrom Myanmar in the January-May period, down 33% year-on-year. Chinese smelters are struggling to adapt to this latestchange in supply-chain mechanics. They are using more scrap as afeedstock but this segment of the market is also tightening,according to the ITA. Refined production is under pressure, dropping 1.3%month-on-month to 13,734 tonnes in May and 10% in the year todate, the Association said. TECHNICALS VS FUNDAMENTALS It's hard to square such supply-side dynamics with theseverity of last week's price fall. Even allowing for a subdued demand outlook, this is a marketthat is struggling with deep-rooted production issues. A sharp rise in visible stocks may suggest otherwise, butthe inflows to the LME warehouse system are all about spreadtightness rather than physical surplus. The Shanghai bear raid appears to have been primarilytechnical in nature and, judging by the speed of the collapseonce support levels were breached, the strategy appears to haveworked. The question now is whether prices can recover from what hasin the past proved to be a producer pain point. If not, a good part of the world's production is under waterat this level, placing further pressure on already strainedsupply. It remains to be seen how this plays out, but China's tinbears may want to book their profits sooner rather than later.

"SARAJEVO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - A Bosnian Serb ex-commander, who was jailed for 28 years by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for rape and enslavement in Bosnia's war of the 1990s, has now been indicted over the killing of Muslim civilians, Bosnia's prosecutors office said on Wednesday. Dragoljub Kunarac, 58, who was the commander of a special unit of the Bosnian Serb army, is accused of taking part in killing of at least six people and torture and persecution of Muslim civilians from villages around the eastern Bosnian town of Foca in July 1992, the prosecutor said in a statement. He is also accused of taking part in looting and burning down Muslim homes, the statement said. Foca was notorious for the mass persecution and killings of Muslims by the Bosnian Serb forces as part of a campaign to form an exclusively Serb region, and for detention camps in which women and young girls were raped and enslaved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) jailed Kunarac in 2001 for 28 years over torture, rape and enslavement in the first case in which the tribunal pronounced rape and enslavement to be crimes against humanity. He is serving his prison term in Germany. The ICTY President Theodor Meron in 2016 denied his request to be released after serving two-thirds of the term. Kunarac is expected to appeal again, after Meron leaves his job in January 2019. Bosnia's state court needs to confirm the indictment against him. It is not clear whether any sentence he may receive if convicted in Bosnia would run alongside the ICTY sentence or be in addition to it. Around 100,000 people were killed and 2 million moved from their homes during Bosnia's 1992-95 war.

House prices in London - which have been hit by worriesabout Brexit and its impact on the city's attractiveness as aglobal finance centre - slid by 4.4% in annual terms, the Officefor National Statistics (ONS) said.     That marked the biggest fall since August 2009.    Reflecting the weakness in the property market since theBrexit referendum more than three years ago, house price growthacross the United Kingdom as a whole slowed to 1.2%, matchingFebruary's six-year low.    Some other surveys have suggested that the market might beborrowing out and analysts said London's dip was not likely tobe followed by the rest of the country.    ""The downturn in London probably isn't a sign of animpending slump elsewhere, but instead reflects the slowdown innet migration, a glut of new-build flats and valuationscorrecting from excessively stretched levels,"" said SamuelTombs, economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics.    London house prices are now 6.4% below their July 2017 peak,a disappointment to some homeowners but a much smaller fall thanthe 17.8% peak-to-trough hit during the global financial crisis.    Furthermore, the current downturn in the capital representsonly a small hit given that London house prices have almostdoubled since the financial crisis, leaving the cityunaffordable for many buyers.    Zoopla, an online property portal, said it the breadth ofprice falls across London's boroughs was narrowing and itexpected the price declines to moderate over 2019 and 2020.        BANK OF ENGLAND UNDER NO PRESSURE ON INFLATION    Separate data from the ONS published on Wednesday showed notonly stable consumer price inflation at 2.0%, but also weakerpipeline price pressures faced by British factories.       ""While the UK consumer price inflation backdrop appearsrelatively benign, the fact that wage growth is holding upsuggests it's too early to be thinking about rate cuts,"" INGeconomist James Smith said.    ""But the increasing uncertainty surrounding Brexit suggestspolicy tightening is equally unlikely this year.""    Some investors think the BoE's next move might be to cutrates as the prospect of an economically damaging no-deal Brexitgrows and U.S.-China trade tensions slow the global economy.    On the other hand, households, whose spending drivesBritain's economy, are have been helped by wages rising at theirfastest pace in a decade, with unemployment at a 44-year low, aswell as by modest inflation.    The ONS said producer input costs, which eventually feedthrough into prices on the high street, fell 0.3% in annualterms in June, the first decline in three years.    The pound and British government bonds were little moved bythe data, which aside from weaker-than-expected factory inputcost readings were as expected in a Reuters poll of economists.

"July 5 (Reuters) - Clubs in elite European competitions, including the Champions League and Europa League, will be allowed to make a fourth substitution if the match goes into extra time from next season, UEFA said on Thursday. FIFA, the sport's governing body, approved the use of a fourth substitute in extra time earlier this year and the rule has been a success at the ongoing World Cup in Russia. According to UEFA's amended laws, teams in the Champions League and Europa League will still be allowed three substitutes in normal time but can make another change when the match goes into extra time. Teams that have made less than three substitutions in the standard 90 minutes can still make a total of four changes throughout extra time. ""A series of amendments to football's Laws of the Game are coming into force immediately in various UEFA competitions,"" European football's governing body said in a statement. UEFA also said that clubs in the Champions League and Europa League can list a maximum of seven substitutes on the match sheet, unless it's for the final, where 12 substitutes can be listed. Laws surrounding the use of electronic communication in the technical area were also amended by UEFA. ""The law ... has been amended to stipulate that any form of electronic communication by team officials is permitted if it directly relates to player welfare or safety, or for tactical/coaching reasons,"" UEFA said.

"ACCRA, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Ghana has ordered a probe into accusations of bribery by European planemaker Airbus to ensure the purchase of three military planes between 2009 and 2015. Ghana was among over a dozen countries involved in a $4-billion settlement Airbus agreed with European and U.S. regulators concerning alleged bribes to clinch sales of its aircraft. Airbus hired - and disguised about 5 million euros in payments to - a close relative of a government official in Ghana with no aerospace experience in connection with the sale of the planes, Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on Friday. The SFO's disclosures, made public after a nearly four-year investigation, came as courts on both sides of the Atlantic formally approved settlements that lift a legal cloud that has hung over Europe's largest aerospace group for years. But in Ghana the matter looks set to continue. The West African country will ""conduct a prompt inquiry to determine the complicity or otherwise of any Ghanaian government official, past or present,"" President Nana Akufo-Addo’s office said in a statement late on Sunday. The National Democratic Congress (NDC), which was in power at the time, denied the bribery claims in a statement on Sunday. ""The reports alleging that Airbus SE paid bribes during the administration of President John Atta Mills and John Mahama are false,"" the statement said.

"* Prices heading for fifth day of gains * Brent reaches highest since early August * Graphic on U.S. inventories: https://tmsnrt.rs/2y7dfqh(Updates prices, adds comment, modifies throughout) By Noah Browning LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Oil futures rose slightly     onTuesday to their highest levels in almost six weeks on optimismthat OPEC and other producing countries may agree to extendoutput cuts to support prices. Brent was up 7 cents at $62.66 a barrel by 0840 GMT,while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were up15 cents, or 0.6%, at $58.17 a barrel. Brent earlier hit its highest level since Aug. 1, while U.S.crude rose to its highest since July 31. Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's new energyminister and a long-time member of the Saudi delegation to theOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), saidthe kingdom's policy would not change and a global deal to cutoil production by 1.2 million barrels per day would bemaintained. He added that the so-called OPEC+ alliance, made up of OPECand non-OPEC producers including Russia, would be in place forthe long term. ""Clearly, the Kingdom wants higher oil prices ... PrinceAbdulaziz made clear that 'no radical' change in the Saudi oilpolicy is forthcoming"", said Tamas Varga of oil brokerage PVM. ""It will be interesting to see if we get any hint from himwhether the producer group in general and Saudi Arabia inparticular sees the need for deeper production cuts"". The OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring committee (JMMC),which reports on compliance with the cuts, is due to meet onThursday in Abu Dhabi. There have been concerns about producers' adherence to theagreement as OPEC members Iraq and Nigeria, among others,exceeded their quota in August and Russia also did not fullycomply. ""Markets will need to see concrete progress on theproduction front, even as the world's economy slows, to sustaingains,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA. Should oil markets close higher on Tuesday it will be thelongest run of gains since late July but headwinds remain due toU.S.-China trade tensions. Executives at the annual Asia Pacific Petroleum Conferencesaid on Monday they expect oil prices this year to be pressuredby uncertainties surrounding the global economy, the U.S.-Chinatrade war and increasing U.S. supplies. In the United States, crude stockpiles are likely to havefallen for a fourth consecutive week last week, a preliminaryReuters poll showed on Monday.

"(Adds details, quotes, context) MOSCOW/YEREVAN, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Rusal's foil-rolling plant Armenal has started cutting production due to U.S. sanctions on the Russian aluminium giant, a source at the plant and a source close to Rusal said. Armenal, which is based in Armenia and employs 670 people, has seen demand for its products fall since Washington imposed sanctions in April against Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska and some of the companies he controls, including Rusal, the sources said. Armenal and Rusal declined official comment. The plant, which produced 33,720 tonnes of foil products in 2017, mainly for the North American and European markets, may temporarily suspend all of its production, the source at the plant said. He did not say when and under what conditions the suspension could take place, but said 184 of Armenal's workers would be transferred to a regime of forced outage with two thirds of their salary by the end of September. The U.S. sanctions hit Rusal's steady supply of raw materials and products within the group. In September, sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters that European customers would avoid signing 2019 supply agreements with Rusal. In August, Rusal started shutting down production at one of its smaller plants, the Nadvoitsky aluminium smelter in Russia's Karelia region. Washington recently said Rusal's customers from before the imposition of sanctions on April 6 could sign new contracts with the company without the risk of being hit with ""secondary sanctions"" themselves. The guidance did not, however, address whether OFAC would extend a deadline of Oct. 23 for U.S. customers to wind down business with Rusal.

Over the last eight weeks Djokovic has resembled the Grand Slam machine that held all four major titles at the same time in 2016. Playing on the same court where Pete Sampras claimed his 14th title, Djokovic has endured more disappointment than joy on Arthur Ashe, mining just three titles from eight finals.

"By Michele Kambas XYLOPHAGOU, Cyprus, March 27 (Reuters) - While the EuropeanUnion and Britain wrestle over the ""Irish backstop"" issue intheir stalled Brexit agreement, a similar problem is taxinganother island at the other end of the continent - Cyprus. In addition to military compounds, 22 communities with11,000 people live in the so-called Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs),a British-controlled vestige of colonial rule that remainsnearly 60 years after the rest of Cyprus gained independence. Under the withdrawal agreement with the EU, so far rejectedby the British parliament, this territory would have remainedlinked to the bloc under a customs union. With no deal, the SBAs, which comprise three percent ofCyprus's land mass and are a farming breadbasket, could bethrown into legal limbo. Trade is an EU competency, which meansany arrangement cannot be hammered out bilaterally betweenNicosia and London. Cypriot residents say they are in the dark. ""Of course it's a concern but unfortunately nobody hasinformed us about anything,"" said Christos Misos, a farmer whohelps run a family business in the community of Xylophagou,famed for its red-soil potatoes, a prized Cypriot export. ""Will we need to pay customs duties for our products to goto Europe? What will happen to us? We want someone to tell us -if they know - because things look really fluid."" 'SPECIAL CASE' EU law does not apply in the SBAs but under the protocolagreed when the Republic of Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, Unionlaw applies in areas such as customs, value added tax (VAT),agriculture and fisheries. ""If Britain leaves the EU without a deal we will be obligedto have customs checks for the trade of goods,"" Cypriotgovernment spokesman Prodromos Prodromou said. The British military bases, he said, were a ""special case"". ""For the moment we do have a deal which is part of thegeneral agreement. Maybe it will be based on that protocol tocontinue the negotiations to find a way out,"" he said. The SBAs are separated into two main areas  - the WesternSovereign Base Area of Akrotiri close to the coastal city ofLimassol, and the Eastern Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia, anenclave which straddles the fertile Kokkinochoria region and theonly transit route to the tourist party town of Agia Napa. They are classified as a British Overseas Territory and helpto project British military power in the Middle East.

"* President forced to act by court ruling * Iohannis says judicial reform a setback for Romania * EU fears new law will undermine judicial independence * Government proposes new anti-graft prosecutor By Radu-Sorin Marinas BUCHAREST, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Romania's president on Friday reluctantly signed off a judicial reform, including a reduction in his own powers, that he called a ""setback for Romanian democracy"". Klaus Iohannis had, together with opposition parties, tried to block the measure which, among other things, removes his right to veto new chief prosecutor appointments, just as the government replaces a sacked anti-corruption prosecutor. The Constitutional Court last month found the measure put forward by the ruling Social Democrats (PSD) to be in line with the constitution, leaving Iohannis, a centrist, no alternative but to sign it into law. The law broadly gives more powers to the justice minister, a political appointee, to the detriment of the president and a magistrates' regulatory body. The European Union, which has kept Romania's justice system under special monitoring since it joined the bloc a decade ago, fears the measure will reverse progress in fighting high-level graft by exposing judges to political interference. ""This change represents a setback for Romanian democracy, a danger signalled by our European partners,"" Iohannis said in a statement. Romania is one of Europe's most corrupt countries, and tens of thousands of Romanians protesting against corruption have taken to the streets several times since the Social Democrats took power in early 2017 and tried to decriminalise several graft offences - most recently in August. Before her sacking in July, chief anti-corruption prosecutor Laura Codruta-Kovesi had secured a spate of convictions against lawmakers, ministers and mayors, exposing conflicts of interest, abuse of power, fraud and the awarding of state contracts in exchange for bribes. Justice Minister Tudorel Toader, who fired Codruta-Kovesi for exceeding her authority, has nominated little-known magistrate Adina Florea to replace her. Speaking before a judicial advisory panel on Monday in her confirmation process, Florea said cases of abuse of office should be investigated by regular prosecutors, not the specialised unit, known as the DNA, that deals with graft. Social Democrat party leader Liviu Dragnea was sentenced in June to three and a half years in prison for incitement to abuse of office, though an appeal is still pending.

"(Adds comments from Abitrigo head, context on wheat trade) By Marcelo Teixeira SAO PAULO, April 15 (Reuters) - A delegation representingthe United States wheat industry is visiting Brazil this week totalk to millers and food industries to gauge potential forhigher import demand once a tariff-free quota is implemented, alocal wheat group told Reuters on Monday. Rubens Barbosa, president of Brazil's wheat millingassociation Abitrigo, said he met the head of U.S. WheatAssociates, Vincent Peterson, and the chief executive of theKansas Wheat Commission, Justin Gilpin, on Monday to discuss theU.S.-Brazil wheat trade. The U.S. delegation, which also included wheat producers anda trader from U.S. company The Andersons, is looking atopportunities to expand business in Brazil, one of the world'sleading wheat importers, under a Brazilian import quota of750,000 tonnes. ""They know Brazil will continue to import significantamounts of wheat in coming years, and they want to increasetheir share of that market,"" Barbosa said. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro announced the tariff-freequota during his visit to the United States last month. It willalso apply to other suppliers such as Russia. Barbosa said that Abitrigo supports the import quota as itwill give the industry access to more suppliers at lower prices.No date has been set yet for its implementation, but governmentis working on the regulation, he added. Barbosa said the United States currently sells around 8percent of the wheat Brazil imports. Brazilian mills buy around 6 million tonnes of wheat peryear, an amount that varies depending on the local crop output.Most of the imported wheat comes from Argentina, which benefitsfrom a zero import tariff as a member of the Mercosur tradebloc.(Reporting by Marcelo TeixeiraEditing by Chizu Nomiyama and Susan Thomas)",UPDATE 1-US wheat delegation in Brazil to gauge import demand under quota,"a delegation representing the united states wheat industry is visiting brazil this week totalk to millers and food industries. the delegation is looking atopportunities to expand business in brazil under a brazilian import quota of750,000 tonnes.",update 1-u.s . wheat industry delegation in brazil to gauge demand for tariff-free import quota

In a breakthrough last month, Ukrainian, Russian and separatist negotiators had agreed that Kiev would grant the territory controlled by the separatists autonomy and hold local elections, prompting protests at home by critics who accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of yielding to Moscow.

"MELBOURNE, Nov 13 (Reuters) - China's appetite for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has not slowed, but its purchases have been spread more evenly, avoiding last year's sudden spike to meet winter demand, Australia's top independent LNG producer said on Tuesday. LNG demand from North Asia's main hubs in Japan, China and South Korea has slowed in recent weeks, raising concern that forecasts for a milder than usual winter may dent consumption. There are also signs that the ongoing Sino-American trade war is starting to dent industry in China. ""We're not seeing a slowdown,"" Woodside Petroleum Chief Executive Peter Coleman said. ""China learned from last year, from the last winter, that the peakiness in demand in the market really distorted the market. It distorted prices, and it meant they were not able to get gas to consumers in China during the peak of winter."" He said China has flattened that demand by buying across the year, while the volume overall has grown. ""So the total is increasing, but the peakiness has gone out of it,"" Coleman told reporters after speaking at the Melbourne Mining Club. Woodside sells most of its LNG to customers in Japan and South Korea but has a tie-up with privately owned ENN Group to boost sales in China. Coleman said Chinese demand for cargoes for delivery in February would be the real measure of how prepared the system is for winter. Those cargoes would need to be bought in December. ""So in December we'll start to see how people feel they're positioned,"" he said. Energy consultants Wood Mackenzie expects China's LNG demand to be 28 million tonnes this winter season, which runs from mid-November to mid-March, up 30 percent from last winter. Coleman said in the short-term there had been no impact from the U.S. trade war with China, as U.S. LNG cargoes were making bigger margins flowing into Europe instead of Asia at the moment. Longer term, the trade war may delay final investment decisions for some new LNG projects in the United States, especially those being built by smaller companies, which need buyers to underpin long term contracts. ""You're not seeing the Chinese buyer in that particular market at the moment,"" Coleman said. Australian-listed LNG Ltd last month said it was delaying a final decision on whether to build its Magnolia LNG plant in Louisiana, citing difficulty in lining up Chinese customers due to the trade war.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-London-March 27: Anticipating particular stress in lease-heavy sectors, Fitch Ratings expects non-payment occurrences by corporates on rental and other leases to increase as the current coronavirus-prompted economic turmoil unfolds.  Fitch does not necessarily consider non-payment by a corporate or infrastructure issuer on its lease payment to be a default under the terms of its Issuer Default Rating (IDR). The threshold default risk addressed by the IDR remains that of the financial obligations whose non-payment would best reflect the uncured failure of that entity. Our criteria states that for non-debt obligations the difference between a Distressed Debt Exchange (DDE) and a robust non-public bilateral negotiation occurring in the normal course of business may be slight, and on that basis a DDE in such circumstances would only be called when there is compelling evidence of its existence. For example, UK retailers have previously used a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), to force permanent reduction or termination across a large portfolio of leases, in circumstances where the lessee had full undisputed use of and access to the properties concerned. The currently highly dislocated conditions for many tenants make the status of such negotiations even more difficult to interpret clearly as a default event. Negotiated settlements between creditors and corporates on financial debt payments would continue to be addressed under our ""Distressed Debt Exchange Rating Criteria"" (August 2019). Separately, we anticipate a rise in offers of deferral or forgiveness on certain debt obligations at the initiative of the lender. Fitch would be unlikely to regard the use of such an offer as a DDE or payment default.  This guidance considers these events in isolation. It is possible, and in many cases likely, that either a lease non-payment or a debt holiday may also coincide with other factors that would warrant a downgrade. However, given the suddenness of the ongoing business disruption and the involuntary suspension of operations experienced by many companies, Fitch believes the potential for otherwise performing businesses to miss or defer lease payments has materially increased, without constituting an event that best reflects the uncured failure of that entity.

"    * Chinese central bank to keep yuan stable     * Currency markets relieved with Australian dollar leading gains     * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh   (Recasts, updates prices, adds comments, changes byline, dateline; previous LONDON)     By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss     NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Tuesday as investors consolidated recent gains and focused less on trade tensions, raising the market's risk appetite and prompting some flows into other currencies such as the euro and Australian dollar.     Ahead of the U.S. Independence Day holiday, market sentiment also improved after the Chinese central bank moved to calm nervous foreign exchange markets following a fall in the renminbi below a key psychological level.     In a statement on the website of the People's Bank of China, Governor Yi Gang said the central bank was closely watching fluctuations in the foreign exchange market and would seek to keep the yuan at a stable and reasonable level.     ""That sentiment may have helped risk appetite a little...but the U.S. July 4th holiday and the July 6th start of U.S.-China trade tariffs are serving to keeping FX investors on the sidelines for now,"" Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said.       In China, protracted weakness of its currency raises the prospects of capital outflows and a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy, creating a new source of concern for currency markets grappling with rising threats to global trade.         The central bank's comments snapped a 10-day losing streak in the value of the renminbi which has seen it lose nearly 4 percent against a trade-weighted basket and nearly 4.5 percent against the dollar over that period.      The yuan fell to 6.7204 per dollar, its weakest since Aug. 7, 2017, before recovering to trade at 6.6466 per dollar.     In mid-morning trading, the dollar was down 0.4 percent against a basket of rival currencies at 94.649, after notching up three consecutive months of gains. Investors are awaiting the release of the Federal Reserve's June meeting minutes and jobs data for validation of policymakers' forecasts for two more rate hikes this year.     The Fed will release minutes of its June meeting on Thursday and investors will parse the data and the statements to gauge whether it is still on track to raise interest rates twice more this year. Monthly payrolls data follow on Friday.     Valuations also remain supportive of the dollar, with its  trade-weighted basket still below long-term averages.     The euro, meanwhile, was supported after Germany's coalition settled a row over migration that had threatened to topple Chancellor Angela Merkel's government. The single currency was 0.1 percent higher at $1.1652.     The Australian dollar, sensitive to developments in China because it is a key buyer of Australian commodity exports, extended gains and rose 0.7 percent on the day to US$0.7387.     ========================================================     Currency bid prices at 10:22AM (1422 GMT)  Description      RIC         Last           U.S. Close  Pct Change     YTD Pct     High Bid    Low Bid                                               Previous                   Change                                                                Session                                             Euro/Dollar      EUR=        $1.1657        $1.1639     +0.15%         -2.83%      +1.1673     +1.1621  Dollar/Yen       JPY=        110.6200       110.8900    -0.24%         -1.82%      +111.1300   +110.6000  Euro/Yen         EURJPY=     128.98         129.06      -0.06%         -4.59%      +129.5500   +128.7600  Dollar/Swiss     CHF=        0.9922         0.9934      -0.12%         +1.84%      +0.9950     +0.9914  Sterling/Dollar  GBP=        1.3171         1.3141      +0.23%         +0.00%      +1.3206     +1.3115  Dollar/Canadian  CAD=        1.3156         1.3184      -0.21%         +4.60%      +1.3207     +1.3132  Australian/Doll  AUD=        0.7387         0.7339      +0.65%         -5.31%      +0.7404     +0.7315  ar                                                                                               Euro/Swiss       EURCHF=     1.1567         1.1562      +0.04%         +0.00%      +1.1585     +1.1559  Euro/Sterling    EURGBP=     0.8849         0.8855      -0.07%         +0.00%      +0.8863     +0.8829  NZ               NZD=        0.6736         0.6714      +0.33%         +0.00%      +0.6752     +0.6689  Dollar/Dollar                                                                                    Dollar/Norway    NOK=        8.1299         8.1700      -0.49%         -0.94%      +8.1809     +8.1105  Euro/Norway      EURNOK=     9.4775         9.5105      -0.35%         -3.77%      +9.5183     +9.4598  Dollar/Sweden    SEK=        8.8435         8.9640      -1.19%         +7.83%      +8.9795     +8.8346  Euro/Sweden      EURSEK=     10.3097        10.4340     -1.19%         +4.78%      +10.4420    +10.3037         (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfus and Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Jane Merriman and Andrea Ricci)   ",FOREX-Dollar weakens as risk appetite improves ahead of U.S. holiday,"the dollar fell on t tuesday as investors consolidated recent gains and focused less on trade tensions. the dollar was down 0.4 percent against a basket of rival currencies at 94.649 , after notching up three consecutive months of gains. the euro was supported after germany's coalition settled a row over migration that had threatened to topple chancellor angela merkel's government.","forex-dollar falls as risk appetite improves , chinese central bank moves to calm markets"

"BRASILIA, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Brazil's presidential election race entered its last 48 hours on Friday, with far-right front-runner Jair Bolsonaro recovering from a near-fatal stabbing that kept him out of the final presidential debate on the country's largest network, TV Globo. Bolsonaro said he was under doctors' orders to stay away, but gave an interview that aired on a rival network at the same time as the debate, raising criticism from other candidates that he was dodging discussion and unprepared to lead the nation. On the last day of campaigning, final opinion polls ahead of Sunday's vote are likely to show the most polarized election in a generation going to a run-off vote between Bolsonaro and leftist Workers Party candidate Fernando Haddad. ""This is wrong. Bolsonaro is avoiding his duty to the population. Anyone who hides from debate and does not show up lacks the qualities needed to govern a country,"" said former finance minister Henrique Meirelles, who is running for the ruling MDB party. In an interview with TV Record that is owned by a supporter, evangelical Christian bishop and media mogul Edir Macedo, Bolsonaro slammed his rival for being a ""puppet"" of jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Haddad, a former mayor of Sao Paulo, was confirmed as top of the Workers Party ticket three weeks ago, replacing Lula, who was barred from running due to a corruption conviction. Earlier, in a live speech over Facebook, Bolsonaro rejected accusations he was racist, sexist and homophobic, though he has faced charges for hate speech against these groups. The former army captain has surged in the election, even though his party is very small, because he has tapped into the anger of Brazilians with rampant political corruption and rising crime. Bolsonaro, an admirer of Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, is running on a law-and-order platform and would ease gun controls so Brazilians can arm themselves against criminals. He has won massive support from the fast-growing evangelical community by vowing to block the legalization of abortion, gay marriage and drugs. Brazilian markets have rallied on the prospect of Bolsonaro stopping a return to power by the Workers Party, which investors blame for plunging Brazil into its worst recession in 2015-2016. Yet Bolsonaro's economic positions remain unclear. Last week he asked his economic advisor Paulo Guedes and his running mate retired general Hamilton Mourão to hold off on making public statements after contradictions emerged over economic policy.

"(Releads, adds Japan PM Abe comment) By Kiyoshi Takenaka TOKYO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Japan and China agreed to work together on Friday to battle the coronavirus outbreak in bilateral cooperation helping offset historic frictions over a maritime territorial dispute.

"By Tiksa Nigeri and Giulia Paravicini ADDIS ABABA, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Hundreds of supporters of an Ethiopian ethnic activist and media entrepreneur gathered outside his house on Wednesday, a day after it was surrounded by security forces following a warning by the prime minister against media owners ""fomenting unrest"". At least 400 young men joined the protest at the property in the capital Addis Ababa, a Reuters witness said, chanting their support for activist Jawar Mohammed and against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the winner of this year's Nobel peace prize. Jawar, who holds a U.S. passport, is the founder of the independent Oromia Media Network and has a very active presence of social media, with 1.4 million Facebook followers, which he has used in the past to organise strikes and protests. Two dozen federal police had surrounded the house on Tuesday night, a Reuters witness said, forcing Jawar's bodyguards to leave. It was not clear why Jawar's house was surrounded, but earlier on Tuesday Abiy, speaking in parliament, had warned unnamed media owners against fomenting unrest. ""Those media owners who don't have Ethiopian passport are playing both ways. When there is peace you are playing here and when we are in trouble you not here,"" he said. ""We tried to be patient. But if this is going to undermine the peace and existence of Ethiopia, whether you speak Amharic or Oromiffa, we will take measures. You can't play both ways."" Amharic and Oromiffa are the languages of the country's largest ethnic groups. Jawar, who promotes non-violent activism and an ""Oromo first"" ideology, returned to Ethiopia from the United States in August last year, a few months after Abiy come to power. Oromo are the country's largest ethnic group, to which both Jawar and Prime Minister Abiy belong. The young men gathered outside Jawar's house call themselves ""Qeerroo"", an Oromo term meaning ""bachelor"" adopted by politically active young men. Wearing hooded sweatshirts, they shouted ""Jawar, Jawar"" and ""Abiy Down! Abiy Down!"" ""I was about to go to bed when I saw Jawar's post that his house was surrounded by security without his knowledge. I called three of my friends and came running and saw more Qeerroos and Qarrees when I arrived at his house,"" Terefe Waltaji, a 27-year-old student, told Reuters. Federal Police Spokesman Jeylan Abdi said they had not received any information on what was happening at Jawar's house. A spokesperson for Abiy did not respond to requests for comment. Abiy, who won the Nobel prize this month for his peacemaking efforts with longtime enemy Eritrea, came to power in April 2018 and began introducing political and economic reforms. Those reforms have opened up what was once one of Africa's most repressive nations, but also stoked violence as emboldened regional strongmen build ethnic powerbases and compete over political influence and resources.

"(Recasts with closing price) By Rajendra Jadhav MUMBAI, June 28 (Reuters) - Malaysian palm oil futuresextended its falling streak on Friday, heading to seven-monthlows as sluggish demand and expectations of higher production incoming months weighed on the vegetable oil market. The benchmark palm oil contract on the BursaMalaysia Derivatives Exchange closed down 0.61%, or 12 ringgit,at 1,951 ringgit ($472.40) per tonne, after falling to 1,946ringgit earlier in the day, the lowest since Nov. 27, 2018. For the quarter, the oil has shed 7% in what would be itsseventh quarterly drop in a row. ""Exports are not picking up despite the correction inprices,"" said one Kuala Lumpur-based trader, referring toFriday's move. ""On the supply side, production is set to rise in comingmonths. That will put additional pressure on prices."" Production typically rises during the third and fourthquarters, and has tended to peak between August and October inrecent years.

"By Kagondu Njagi KIBUMBU, Kenya, Aug 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Four years ago, Njeru Kamuru nearly quit dairy farming. But when he learned that a solar-powered milk-cooling plant was to be built in his Kenyan village, he changed his mind. Before then, Kamuru said, he struggled to sell more than half of the 12 litres of milk his brace of cows gave during their morning and evening milking sessions. Selling those six litres earned him about a dollar; the rest of the milk went to his relatives on credit or was drunk by his wife and four children. Breaking even was hard, he said, with the key problem a lack of refrigerated storage. ""I could spend the whole day at the farm waiting to sell milk to my fellow village customers,"" Kamuru told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in Kibumbu village in central Kenya. And if the morning's milk supply was difficult to sell - and it was - he was at least able to pasteurize it to ensure it did not go off. The evening's milk supply was trickier. ""If there were no customers, it all went to waste,"" he said. Others in the Kibumbu Dairy Farmers Association had the same problem, so they approached the governor of Tharaka Nithi County and demanded that he honour a 2012 campaign pledge to construct a milk-cooling plant. In 2015, the solar-powered facility opened, using county funds. These days, Kamuru no longer sells milk to the villagers. His family uses two litres a day, while the rest goes to the community-owned plant. ""The amount I deliver is recorded every day, and then I am paid at the end of the month,"" he said. ACCESS 24/7 Kenyans often struggle with the country's unreliable electricity supply, with the problem particularly acute in rural areas. For the country's dairy farmers - who, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), have 3.2 million head of dairy cattle - it's a particular problem. Kibumbu's solar milk-cooling plant ensures that farmers like Kamuru can store their milk safely, day or night, without it going off. The timing is good: demand for dairy products is rising fast, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas, according to the Kenya Livestock Producers Association (KLPA). ""This means that farmers must have access to storage facilities that work around the 24-hour clock without interruption,"" said Patrick Kimani, who heads the KLPA. ""Solar-powered milk coolers provide such a solution."" Typically, local governments pay for milk-cooling plants, then hand over ownership to dairy associations, Tharaka Nithi County Governor Muthomi Njuki said in a phone interview. It is then the responsibility of the farmers to pay for maintenance, Njuki added. The Tharaka Nithi facility does that by deducting 10 percent of each farmer's monthly earnings. Apart from being community-owned, the KLPA's Kimani said, solar milk-cooling plants are cheap to maintain and can deal with the blackouts that continue to trouble Kenya. GROWING SOLUTION The dairy industry is an important part of Kenya's economy, worth about 3.5 percent of GDP, the FAO estimates, with about 2 million people directly or indirectly working in it. Kimani said the country has about one million dairy farmers, but just 15 percent can connect to the national electricity grid to refrigerate their milk. Some of the rest rely on one of 50 solar cooling plants set up in 10 counties since 2014, Kimani said. With the cost of solar technology falling, he added, building more plants will become increasingly affordable in coming years to help Kenya's 500-plus dairy associations. With demand for dairy products climbing, Kimani said, there are plans for plants in key production areas to boost their capacity to process milk into products such as yoghurt and milk powder. At the office of the Kibumbu Dairy Farmers Association, manager Lucy Muthoni divides her day between monitoring the milk containers that farmers bring in, and checking that the solar system on the plant's roof is keeping the coolers humming. The plant receives more than 5,000 litres of milk a day, she said, with about one-third consumed by people in nearby Chuka town and the rest sent to the capital, Nairobi, for processing. Solar power and milk make for a good combination, she said. ""Milk is most likely to go bad when the day is hot. Yet it is when it is hot that the solar system can absorb and store more energy to keep the coolers operating during the day and at night,"" Muthoni told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. And, she added, the fact that milk can be refrigerated means more local people are turning to dairy farming. MILK, NOT MAIZE At Munene Njoka's three-acre farm in Kanjau village in central Kenya, he is cutting his maize crop even though harvest time is three weeks away. The reason? The five cows in his barn. Njoka chops the maize into pieces then mixes it with dry Napier grass to make silage, a delicacy that he said makes his cows more productive. Njoka, who learned the technique during a farmers' field day, has no concerns about feeding his entire maize crop to his cows. Doing so, he said, brings in more money. ""A single cow used to give me about eight litres of milk in a day before I learned about silage,"" the father of two said. ""Now I can get as much as 20 litres from a single cow."" That brings in 100,000 Kenyan shillings ($1,000) a month, he said. It beats growing maize to feed his family, he said, because if the rains fail then the crop will wither leaving him nursing a financial loss and stuck in an cycle of hunger. ""After investing part of the money back to the farm, buying food, paying school fees and health bills, I still have enough to take my family out during weekends,"" said Njoka. That echoes Kamuru's experience: for him, keeping dairy cows generates more income than growing maize, in part because maize prices are kept low by cheap imports. ""But milk prices are always rising due to demand from a growing urban population. This assures me of a steady income all year round,"" he said. (Reporting by Kagondu Njagi.

"(Adds quote, context) DUBAI, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Bahrain's interior ministry said on Tuesday that it would stop issuing new visas to Qatari nationals, escalating measures against Qatar more than a year into a diplomatic row. The statement, carried on state news agency BNA, said Qatari students studying in the kingdom and other Qatari citizens with existing visas would not be affected. It also said the move came in response ""hostile acts"" by Qatari authorities. It did not elaborate. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of financing terrorism. Doha denies that and says the boycott is an attempt to rein in its support for reform. In October, Bahrain said it would impose entry visas on Qatari nationals as a security measure. Citizens from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council countries are otherwise supposed to be able to travel within the GCC carrying only an identity card.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Barcelona/London-September 11: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Stichting GGZ Noord-Holland-Noord (GGZ-NHN) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'A' with Stable Outlooks and a Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR at 'F1'. GGZ-NHN is a leading mental healthcare institution focusing on the prevention and treatment of severe psychological problems and psychiatric disorders. Fitch rates GGZ-NHN on a standalone basis using its Revenue-Supported Rating Criteria. GGZ-NHN effectively merged in 2018 with Triversum, which provides mental healthcare for children. KEY RATING DRIVERS Revenue Defensibility - Midrange GGZ-NHN's activities are concentrated in the province of Noord-Holland across three districts, including Kop van Noord-Holland, Noord-Kennemerland and West-Friesland. Most of GGZ-NHN's 10,000 patients live in those three districts, which has a total estimated population of about 620,000. There are five other main mental healthcare institutions in the area, although GGZ-NHN has a 78% market share (2017 before the merger). As GGZ-NHN is the main specialist institution in the area, its market dominance provides a negotiating strength on key contracts. Patient satisfaction is in line with the national average. Triversum has about 2,150 patients in the northern part of Noord-Holland. This is important as proximity is a key factor in patients' choice. Institutions such as GGZ-NHN generally receive enough funding from insurers, the state and municipalities to cover the costs and breakeven. However, this is dependent on the contracts the institutions negotiate annually with the insurers, as well as the funding they receive from the state/municipalities not being cut. The latter accounts for 41% of funding (2017 before the merger), but any change in tariffs from insurers is unlikely to affect demand as these are essential treatments and the regulator controls the tariffs, which rise annually in line with inflation. Operating Risk - Midrange GGZ-NHN has well-identified cost drivers and low potential volatility for its main items. It has flexibility for the timing of major life-cycle costs and limited near-term capex is expected over the next five years. Nevertheless, the healthcare sector has a fairly rigid expenditure structure, with staffing costs making up about 70% of total expenses. About 75% of this is for direct personnel (therapists, nurses)  with the remainder for management and support departments. GGZ-NHN has adequate resources and labour, with limited volatility. One of the challenges for the Dutch healthcare sector is ensuring healthcare providers have sufficient medical staffing, in particular for psychologists and psychiatrists. GGZ-NHN says it aims to retain therapists by being an innovative and progressive healthcare provider. We do not expect significant cost pressures due to contract renegotiations. Financial Profile - Stronger With a turnover of about EUR110 million, GGZ-NHN has posted a profit of between EUR0.2 million and EUR8.2 million over the past five years, in line with its not-for-profit status. At end-2017, GGZ-NHN had total debts of EUR31.3 million, a decrease of EUR9.3 million from end-2013. Triversum has a turnover of about EUR22 million and debt of EUR3.8 million at end-2017. With the merger with Triversum, EBITDA  could oscillate in a wide range but we still expect it to remain above EUR6 million. In its scenario, Fitch expects its net debt to EBITDA to remain about 3.5(x). Fitch assesses the liquidity profile as weak as the liquidity cushion is below 0.33. Nevertheless, this is strong compared with peers in the mental healthcare sector. GGZ-NHN has made progress in increasing efficiency, in Fitch's view. It is looking to decentralise its operations with flexible assertive community treatment (FACT) teams providing care and treatment to patients with serious psychiatric disorders in their home environment. The FACT model was developed by GGZ-NHN and has been widely adopted across the Netherlands and internationally. The decentralisation of its operations is expected to maintain or help to increase market share and should help improve employee and patient satisfaction. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade could result from sustained maintenance of the net debt/EBITDA ratio at about 2x along with an improvement of liquidity, or a review of the assessment with an improvement in revenue defensibility to Strong, or a review of the assessment with an improvement in operating risk to Strong. A downgrade could result from a sustained weakening of GGZ-NHN's net debt/EBITDA ratio to above 4x or a review of the assessments: a deterioration of revenue defensibility to Weaker  or a deterioration of the operating risk to Weaker.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

"(Adds details from report, background) Jan 24 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is mulling to use the threat of high tariffs to raise pressure on the European Union, the United States and other nations to strike trade deals with Britain, The Times newspaper reported on Saturday. Johnson and his cabinet ministers discussed using tariffs as ""leverage"" in an effort to accelerate trade talks at a meeting this week which could result in taxes of 30% on some types of French cheese and 10% on German cars, the newspaper reported. In an EU exit strategy committee meeting held on Thursday, ministers agreed that the tariffs should be put out for consultation, according to the report. Ministers also agreed to prioritise Japan, U.S., Australia and New Zealand as ""tier one"" countries in negotiations and other countries as ""tier two"", the newspaper added. The UK will largely replicate the EU tariff schedule which will be published and lodged at the World Trade Organisation, according to the newspaper. Johnson will lay out the negotiating plan in the first week of February, the report added, citing officials from Brussels.

"By Simon Evans LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland, Oct 18 (Reuters) - At a time when so much focus on both sides of the Irish border is on the European Union and its future relationship with the United Kingdom, Declan Devine has another kind of Europe on his mind. The manager of League of Ireland club Derry City knows that positive results in the last three games of the season could earn the club a spot in the Europa League and potential fixtures against some of the continent's traditional giants. That would complete a swift turnaround in fortunes for a club that finished last season one place above the relegation zone in the 10-team league, which plays during the summer months. The 'Candystripes' are in an unusual position. While based in Northern Ireland, violence in the Bogside area where Derry's Brandywell ground is located in the 1970s during the conflict referred to as the “Troubles” led to them switching to play in the Republic’s football league in 1985. Sitting in his office, at a gym on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Londonderry, former player and youth coach Devine says that when he returned to the club in November, he inherited a sorry situation. ""For me, last year there were teams walking into Brandywell, taking the three points, and walking back out again. There was no fight or heartbeat about the club,"" he said. ""It was the same with the fans, everyone was down. Attendances were down... there was no rapport between fans and players,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""We had to re-establish an identity for the club."" Such a state of affairs rankled with Derry-born Devine, who was a young fan at the club's first game after they joined the League of Ireland following 13 years in the wilderness -- they had quit league football in the north in 1972. ""It wasn’t a nice place. The security forces, the Brits (army) and the cops were everywhere, people were being hounded out of the city. It wasn’t the best place in the world but it was home, it was where we were,"" he said. 'SMALL COG IN THE MACHINE' The re-formation of the football club changed the mood -- at least on a Friday night when the floodlights lit up the Bogside. ""There was rioting, there were people being killed, it wasn’t a nice place but when you went to Brandywell and people couldn’t get in the door, they were squashed in, it was like heaven, it was incredible. ""People all singing and in the scarves... the enjoyment, the roar and the smell of the football in those first few years it was a release for everyone. ""If you were growing up then, Derry City was a big part of your life. In 1985 when Derry City came along, it changed your life, I was just hooked and have been ever since,"" he said. Devine led a total clearout of the playing staff, bringing in 24 new players, a mixture of some with local roots, Scottish and Irish and foreign players. Yet he made sure that all were given a crash course in the history of the city and the club. ""The week before the season, we took them on a tour of the city – we went around the murals, we went around the walls, it was pissing with rain, we were soaked to the skin but we all did the tour together,"" he said. ""We heard about the tough times, about the (1689) siege of Derry, about Bloody Sunday, about hunger strikers and all the rest. It gave us that wee bit of feeling that we are only a small cog in the machine here and one day we will be gone, but that the history of Derry City is very important to the people of Derry,"" he said. ""The local-based players have been brilliant but the ones from outside have been every bit as good as well,"" he said. The result has been a team that has no shortage of spirit as they have pushed themselves to fourth place with three games to go -- unlike most of Europe, the season began in late February and runs until late October. Yet while so much of Derry City's history is connected with the Bogside and the ""Troubles"", Devine says he operates a strictly non-sectarian approach. ""One thing we don’t talk about here is our own personal backgrounds, no-one cares about religion, or what our past has been. ""But if you are here representing this city, you must work extremely hard, you must be proud of where you are playing your football, you are also representing 118,000 people. ""We are in a privileged position to represent this city on a Friday night and we are fighting for every single person in our community.""

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-New York-March 30: Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc.'s (CECONY) issuance of $1.6 billion senior unsecured debentures. The two tranche transaction is comprised of $600 million 3.35% debentures, series 2020 A due 2030 and $1 billion 3.95% debentures, series 2020 B due 2050. CECONY's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'BBB+'/Outlook Negative. The new senior unsecured debentures will rank pari passu with CECONY's existing senior unsecured obligations. Key Rating Drivers Coronavirus Potential Impact: CECONY's service territory has been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and as such, CECONY's credit metrics are likely to weaken. Of particular concern is the revenue impact from lower kilowatt hours sales and escalation of bad debt expense. Fitch acknowledges that CECONY benefits from revenue decoupling and bad debt expense recovery; however, such mechanisms may not be fully protective of CECONY's revenue stream or expense recovery could be deferred. Liquidity is adequate to cover 2020 needs and there aren't any significant operational concerns at this time. Low-Risk Business Profile: Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, CECONY's ratings reflect the historically predictable cash flows of its regulated electric and gas delivery businesses, which benefit from full and timely recovery of fuel and commodity costs. Various regulatory mechanisms have historically supported CECONY's long-term financial stability, including revenue decoupling, forward-looking test years and trackers for large operating expenses. It is not known at this time if the economic impacts of extended the coronavirus shutdowns, could alter the application of revenue decoupling or bad debt expense recovery. Multi-year settlements are frequently achieved in New York. On a negative note, authorized ROEs at CECONY are some of the lowest in the nation. Rate Settlement: CECONY filed a joint proposal with the major parties in the case on Oct. 18, 2019, which was approved on Jan. 16, 2020. Under the terms of the settlement, CECONY will be allowed to raise electric base rates $113 million in 2020, $370 million in 2021 and $326 million in 2022. The settlement calls for gas base rate increases of $84 million in 2020, $122 million in 2021 and $167 million in 2022. Electric and gas rates are set on an 8.8% ROE and 48% equity capitalization. The enacted rate plan provides for performance incentives and allows the company to earn up to 9.3% before earnings are shared with customers. The enacted rate plan includes electric earnings incentives for energy efficiency and other potential incentives of $69 million in 2020, $74 million in 2021, and $79 million in 2022 and gas earnings incentives of $20 million in 2020, $22 million in 2021, and $25 million in 2022. The enacted rate plan also includes penalties for not meeting specified targets related to service, reliability, and safety, among other matters. While the 8.8% ROE is lower than the national average, it is the outcome of NYSPSC's formulaic approach to ROE and is a reflection of the 75 bps decline in the 30-year treasury rate since CECONY filed its rate case in January 2019 and the 25 bps decline since the prior three-year joint proposal filed in September 2016. REV Neutral to Credit Profile: Fitch believes efforts to transform the traditional utility distribution business model of New York transmission and distribution (TD) utilities, under the scope of the Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) initiative, bear no near-term impact on CECONY's credit profile. Fitch expects REV-related capex to represent less than 5% of capital investments over the forecast horizon. Recovery of REV-related capital spending continues to be assessed as part of the rate-making process, and the utility can earn additional incentives through NYSPSC-approved earnings adjustment mechanisms. Execution risk associated with digitizing the grid and emergence of disruptive technologies are potential longer-term concerns. Clean Energy Legislation: New York enacted the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in July 2019. The legislation requires that 70% of electricity procured by utilities in the state be produced by renewable energy systems by 2030 and that by 2040 the statewide electrical demand system to have zero emissions. The law also codifies state targets for energy efficiency, offshore wind, solar and energy storage. A 22-member Climate Action Council is charged with recommending mandates, regulations and other matters to implement the legislation. Fitch notes that it is too early to assess the implications of the legislation on CECONY's operations or credit quality. Reduced Capex: Management expects capex of roughly $9.7 billion over 2020-2022. The 5% reduction from the prior forecast reflects the lower approved ratebase in CECONY's recently enacted rate plan. Capex is primarily earmarked toward replacement of aged infrastructure; network reliability enhancement, including a sizable advanced metering infrastructure program; leak-prone pipe replacement; and projects addressing the REV initiative. Fitch projects CECONY's internally generated cash flows to support, on average, 80% of capex over the forecast period. Weaker Credit Metrics: CECONY's credit metrics weakened in 2018 as a result of tax reform. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, Fitch expected that recently enacted rate plan would forestall any significant recovery in credit metrics over the 2020-2022 rate plan period. This is the result of the below average 8.8% ROE and continued effects of tax reform. CECONY's FFO leverage is expected to average approximately 4.7x over the rating horizon, with some years approaching the threshold of 5.0x. Fitch is concerned that the potential impact on revenue and cash flow due to the coronavirus will further erode CECONY's limited headroom. Parent-Subsidiary Linkage: There is a strong rating linkage between parent company, Consolidated Edison, Inc. (ED) and CECONY. A downgrade of CECONY, given strong operational and financial ties, with the utility generally contributing nearly 90% of ED's consolidated cash flows, would likely result in a downgrade of ED. A downgrade of ED would likely result in a downgrade of Orange  Rockland Utilities, Inc. (ORU), given the subsidiary's small size within the corporate structure. The linkage also reflects a shared bank credit facility and parental support in the form of equity infusions to maintain the utilities' statutory capital structures. Given the linkages, Fitch would allow a maximum of a one-notch differential between the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of ED and CECONY and ORU. Derivation Summary CECONY's credit profile as a TD regulated utility is currently considered weaker to peers New York State Electric and Gas Co. (NYSEG; BBB+/Stable) and Connecticut Light  Power Company (CLP; A-/Stable). CECONY's already weakening credit measures due to the recently enacted rate plan are expected to be further pressured in light of the current coronavirus impact on CECONY's service territory. On the positive side, CECONY enjoys greater financial scale than its peers, with EBITDA that is nearly 4.0x the size of the next largest peer utility, CLP. CLP's higher rating partly reflects the benefit of a larger exposure to constructive Federal Energy Regulation Commission regulation. Fitch considers the New York and Connecticut regulatory regimes to be somewhat restrictive, with below-average authorized ROEs. Key Assumptions --Implementation of the CECONY enacted rate plan effective Jan. 1, 2020; --Consolidated capex of $9.7 billion over 2020-2022; --Parent-level dividend payout ratio between 65% and 70%. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --Given the Negative Rating Outlook, no positive rating action is anticipated in the near term; --FFO-adjusted leverage less than 4.0x on a sustained basis; --Unexpected improvement in New York regulatory environment. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --A significant deterioration in the New York regulatory compact; --FFO-adjusted leverage greater than 5.0x on a sustained basis. Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario Ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579. Liquidity and Debt Structure Group liquidity is supported by a $2.25 billion shared bank credit facility that expires in December 2022. In April 2019, the credit facility termination date was extended to December 2023 with respect to banks with aggregate commitments of $2.2 billion. The full amount of the facility is available to CECONY. As of Dec. 31, 2019, approximately $1.539 billion of consolidated liquidity was available, including $558 million of unused facilities and $981 million of cash and cash equivalents. The bank credit facility has a covenant that requires total debt/total capital to be no greater than 65%. All ED entities were in compliance as of Dec. 31, 2019. Consolidated long-term debt maturities are considered manageable, with $518 million due in 2020, $1.967 billion due in 2021 and $437 million due in 2022.

"(Corrects event host in paragraph 3) By Shoon Naing and Antoni Slodkowski NAYPYITAW, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Myanmar leader Aung San SuuKyi on Monday urged global investors to put their money intoMyanmar, seeking to offset the negative impact of the Rohingyacrisis and slow pace of economic reforms. Suu Kyi touted Myanmar's economic potential, its attractivegeographical location, expanding domestic markets and youngpopulation. She also listed some of the reforms undertaken byher government since coming to power in 2016. ""I stand here to reaffirm our commitment to continue ourreform and to build an investment-friendly environment,"" Suu Kyisaid in the capital Naypyitaw, launching the firstgovernment-backed investment conference hosted by the Union ofMyanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry. ""Please do come to Myanmar, soak in an atmosphere brimmingwith opportunities and witness our new-found economic vibrancywith your own eyes,"" she told a crowd of business people,diplomats and journalists gathered at a conference hall. While there were relatively few details on planned reforms,the conference itself could signal a shift in the government'sapproach to the business community. Until now, investors have complained the government hasfocused largely on ending the country's myriad armed conflicts,neglecting economic reforms and their needs. Suu Kyi did not mention in her speech the Rohingya crisisand the chilling impact it has had on investment. Manybusinesses worry that some of the Western sanctions that stifledthe economy under army rule could be reinstated. About 730,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from westernRakhine State into Bangladesh since a military crackdown in 2017after Rohingya insurgents attacked security posts. A U.N. mandated fact-finding mission said that Myanmar'smilitary carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingyawith ""genocidal intent"" and called for top generals to beprosecuted. Myanmar rejected the findings. The International Monetary Fund said last year its dataindicated that some foreign investors were delaying finalapproval of projects until there was clarity about how thesituation may unfold. The European Union is considering trade sanctions on Myanmarover the crisis, potentially stripping the country oftariff-free access to the world's largest trading bloc. Themeasures could include Myanmar's lucrative textile industry andpotentially put thousands of jobs at risk. Separately this month, the EU imposed tariffs on rice fromMyanmar and Cambodia to curb a surge in imports. Suu Kyi did not mention the EU measures in her speech. The World Bank said last month it expected Myanmar's grossdomestic product to fall to 6.2 percent in 2018-19 fiscal yearfrom 6.8 percent the year before. It saw ""elevated downsiderisks from intensifying impacts of the Rakhine crisis,"" amongother factors contributing to slowing growth.

"(Repeats to add update tag) By Krystal Hu and Jeffrey Dastin NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc will only receive vital supplies at its U.S. and UK and other European warehouses until April 5, its latest move to free up inventory space for medical and household goods in high demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The change does not mean Amazon will stop selling non-essential items like phone cases and toys for now, only that products may be more likely to run out of stock in the next few weeks or that sellers have to ship directly to consumers. The move reflects how the global spread of the virus has created challenges for retailers, from supply chain to delivery. In a note sent to sellers on Tuesday, Amazon said it is seeing increasing online shopping demand. As its household staples and medical supplies are running out of stock, it will prioritize certain categories in order to ""quickly receive, restock, and ship these products to customers."" Amazon defined several categories as essential products that can continue shipping, including baby products; health and household items; beauty and personal care; grocery; industrial and scientific; and pet supplies. Books are included as well. ""We understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers,"" Amazon said in a statement. The company said the new protocol applies to its retail inventory as well as to the products of third-party sellers on its platform. The move follows Amazon's Monday announcement that it will hire 100,000 more workers, as the world's largest online retailer is trying to meet growing online shopping need from people who stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak. LESS AD REVENUE? The news may hurt demand for lucrative services that Amazon offers to merchants, like advertising. Amy Roskelley, owner of Utah-based Health Beet, said she pays Amazon around $1,000 a month to promote her flatware products that help consumers portion their meals. Now that she can’t add inventory to Amazon’s warehouses, she plans to cut ad spend in half. “It’s hard for me to justify spending money if I don’t have enough inventory to fill” customers’ orders, she said. Roskelley is considering other ways to reduce her dependence on Amazon, too, whether shipping directly to customers or driving traffic to her own website. ""I have been concerned that they'll shut down Amazon’s warehouses and won’t ship out at all, and that would just devastate me,"" she said. Amazon has yet to indicate any such closures. Still, the months-long outbreak is posing challenges to the Seattle e-commerce company's operations. Merchant Zengxie Pang said Amazon's change came just as the China-based seller's factories had resumed production. ""Now we can't ship to warehouses until April,"" Pang said. ""We are already seeing a rising demand for kitchen supplies, and they will likely run out of stock."" Chief executive of personal massager company LuLu, Michael Gawrychowski, said his supplier in China woke him in the middle of the night with news of Amazon's change. ""People are freaking out,"" he said. Gawrychowski immediately sent a request for a 25,000-unit shipment. That was rejected, but a second request went through, he said. Amazon's two-day shipping guarantee has in some cases slowed to up to seven-day delivery, Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note. Tuesday's announcement aims to speed up the operation, at the risk of limiting the availability of non-essential items like electronics that typically are a big part of Amazon's business. ""This change will likely force some third-party sellers currently dependent on Amazon to shift sales to other marketplaces (eBay, Wish, Walmart, Facebook Marketplace, etc.), or onto their own websites,"" Sebastian said. Customer searches for popular items including iPhone cases, AirPods and Apple Watch bands have fallen from the week prior, an indication of shifting shopper interests, according to research from Helium 10, which provides tools to sellers. Workers at bars, gyms, theaters and other non-essential businesses have been furloughed to help contain the spread of the deadly virus, and President Donald Trump on Monday said the U.S. economy may be sliding into recession. For sellers, which account for over half of sales on Amazon, the new warehouse policy only adds to the economic uncertainty they are facing, said Chris McCabe, founder of Amazon seller consultancy ecommerceChris.com. ""Sellers are rethinking their entire strategies for selling in 2020,"" he said, (Reporting by Krystal Hu; Additional reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Jeffery Dastin in San Franscico and Elvira Pollina in Milan; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Lisa Shumaker, Sandra Maler and Cynthia Osterman)","RPT-UPDATE 4-Amazon warehouses receive only vital supplies in U.S., Europe amid coronavirus","amazon.com inc will only receive vital supplies at its u.s . and uk and other european warehouses until april 5. the move reflects how the global spread of the virus has created challenges for retailers. the news may hurt demand for lucrative services that amazon offers to merchants, like advertising.",rpt-update 1-amazon.com to prioritize essential supplies in its warehouses until april 5 amid coronavirus
"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10117064 Fitch Ratings-Sydney-April 09: Exposure in U.S. broadly syndicated loan (BSL) CLOs under Fitch's surveillance to loans on Fitch's lists of Top Loans of Concern (TLoC) and Tier 2 Loans of Concern (combined 'Loans of Concern') have increased due to additional loan issuers being added, Fitch Ratings says in a report published today. The average exposure in U.S. BSL CLO portfolios to issuers named on our Loans of Concern lists in Fitch's most recent U.S. Leveraged Loan Default Insight (LLDI) report is 10.0%. This is up from a 6.0% average at the end of fourth-quarter 2019 of the Loans of Concern in the portfolios at that time. Overall, the combined Loans of Concern totalled $233.6 billion as noted in Fitch's most recent LLDI report, exceeding 16% of the loan index. The increase is primarily a result of Fitch adding a number of loans from issuers that face a high level of risk due to the economic effects of coronavirus pandemic. Most of the weak exposure is found within the energy, retail and healthcare/pharmaceutical industries. From mid-February to the end of March, U.S. BSL CLOs under Fitch's surveillance have decreased exposure to obligors in industries considered at high risk from business disruptions, low consumer demand and government-required shutdowns. Gaming, leisure and entertainment and retail exposures have declined the most, falling by 0.36% and 0.23%, respectively, of the aggregate BSL CLO portfolio under Fitch's surveillance to contribute 5.44% and 3.58% to the total outstanding. Some of the most widely held loans in CLOs that are on Fitch's Loans of Concern lists are newly added issuers, including Cineworld Cinemas Ltd., Toro Private Holdings I Ltd. and BCP Renaissance Parent LLC. New additions to the Tier 2 list are primarily loans for issuers with high coronavirus disruption risk and a composite issuer rating of 'B-' or lower. Not all weak exposure is linked to the fallout from the coronavirus, and some obligors have been on a list for some time. In pharmaceuticals, for example, Endo International plc (ccc+*/negative outlook) has been dealing with opioid-related litigation. GTT Communications was downgraded to 'B-'/Stable Outlook in November 2019 due to underperformance. Fitch has also revised its default forecast for U.S. leveraged loans for 2020 to 5%-6%, up from 3% previously forecast at the end of last year. This equates to $80 billion defaulting in 2020, surpassing the previous high of $78 billion in 2009. The default forecast for 2021 is 8%-9%, or more than $120 billion. Defaults are expected to be most acute in the energy, non-food retail, restaurant and travel/leisure sectors. The average default exposure at the end of March was 0.7% on average for the 760 U.S. BSL CLO portfolios under surveillance. This will increase in the current environment, but it should stay below the overall market level primarily due to CLO diversification requirements, active management of CLOs and different calculation methodologies.

"Nov 4 (Reuters) - Australian Pacific Coal Ltd said on Monday it will appeal a state regulator's decision to not extend the life of a mothballed coal mine. The New South Wales Independent Planning Commission in August approved the restart of underground operations at the Dartbrook Coal Mine in the state, but rejected a five-year extension beyond the current permit which ends Dec. 5, 2022. The Commission said it was not in the public interest to extend the mine's life, and its decision highlighted the increased scrutiny authorities are showing towards coal mine approvals. There has been growing pressure from environmental groups to get Australia to move away from coal, and the global push has seen buyers shift towards cleaner or renewable fuel sources. Australian Pacific, in its appeal, hopes to have the decision amended to allow mining operations to restart and give it a ""reasonable time frame for the mining to facilitate the necessary capital costs which will be incurred.""

"LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - For England quick Tom Curran and his all-rounder brother Sam, the dream is to play test cricket together having experienced it in limited-overs cricket. Tom played both his test matches during the 2017-18 Ashes tour but is more regular in one-dayers and was also part of last year's World Cup winning squad. Sam has played 17 tests since his debut against Pakistan in June 2018. ""I've only played a couple of test matches, but I've definitely got huge test ambitions still,"" Tom said in a video chat jointly with his brother. ""Now it's about getting that balance between the two, developing my skills and waiting for my chance. ""It would be amazing to play a test with Sam. That's definitely a huge ambition of ours.""

""We have played a couple of games in the one-day format together. To play for England in general is obviously a great privilege, but playing with your brother makes it an extra special feeling.""

Sam was keen to play under former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni at Chennai Super Kings, while Tom was looking forward to joining England team mates Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler at Rajasthan Royals. ""There has been some talk about the IPL in terms of scheduling later in the year, but no-one knows,"" said Sam. ""It might happen this year; it might be cancelled.

"LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Trinidad-born British author V.S. Naipul, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2001, has died at his home in London aged 85, the BBC reported on Saturday. Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul, who began writing in the 1950s, won numerous coveted literary awards during his career during which he wrote critically acclaimed novels such as ""A House for Mr Biswas"", ""In a Free State"" and ""A Bend in the River"". In a statement, his wife Nadira Naipaul called him a ""giant in all that he achieved"" and said he had died surrounded by ""those he loved having lived a life which was full of wonderful creativity and endeavour"", the BBC said. Born in Trinidad in 1932 into an Indian family, Naipaul was raised in relative poverty. He moved to England at 18 after receiving a scholarship to University College, Oxford. He wrote his first novel while at Oxford, but it was not published. He left university in 1954 and found a job as a cataloguer in London's National Portrait Gallery. His first published novel, ""The Mystic Masseur"", written in 1955, was poorly received at first but the following year won the first of his literary awards, the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize for young authors. He received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth in 1989. ""When I learnt to write I became my own master, I became very strong, and that strength is with me to this very day,"" he told Reuters in 2010.

"By Chris Kahn WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - As Iowa's Democrats entered their party's caucuses on Monday, defeating President Donald Trump in November's election was at the top of their minds when considering which candidate to support for the party's 2020 presidential nomination, according to preliminary findings by the National Election Pool (NEP). The NEP, a consortium of news organizations including Reuters that runs election-day polling through Edison Research, found most caucus-goers were simply looking for a winner instead of someone who agrees with them on the issues. Here are some highlights from the entrance poll based on interviews with 745 Iowa Democrats as they headed into the caucuses. The results will be updated as more interviews are collected. -- Six in 10 caucus-goers said they were looking for a Democratic nominee who they think can beat Trump. About four in 10 said they wanted a nominee who agrees with them on major issues. -- Three in 10 said they were attending the Iowa caucuses for the first time, which appears to be below that of 2016. Four years ago, 44% of people attending the Iowa caucuses said they were doing so for the first time. In 2008, 57% said they were new to the Iowa caucuses. -- Nearly a third of Democrats said before entering the caucuses that they picked their candidate in the last few days. That appears to be higher than the number of late deciders in 2016. Four years ago, 16% of caucus-goers said they had made their choice in the last month or earlier. -- Healthcare was the issue that mattered most to Iowa caucus-goers. About four in 10 said that was the issue they cared most about when thinking about picking a nominee. Two in 10 said it was the climate, another two in 10 said it was income inequality and one in 10 said it was foreign policy. -- The entrance poll also asked Democrats about which candidate they were supporting for the nomination. The selections are not predictive of the outcome, however, given that many Democrats will change their preferences if their chosen candidate does not win enough support in the caucuses. Edison, a Somerville, New Jersey-based exit polling firm, has been providing election-day poll data to a consortium of news organizations through the National Election Pool since 2004.

"(Adds quotes, details) WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - Mike Pompeo will make hisfirst trip to Russia as U.S. secretary of state next week fortalks with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister SergeiLavrov on ""aggressive and destabilizing actions"" Moscow hastaken around the world, a senior State Department official saidon Friday. Pompeo would reiterate U.S. concerns about Russia's roles inVenezuela and Syria and its breach of the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, as well as Russian attempts tomeddle in U.S. elections, the official told reporters inpreviewing Pompeo's trip to Moscow and Sochi next week. ""We have many areas of disagreement with the Russiangovernment and the secretary will have a very candidconversation about concerns in our bilateral relationship,"" theofficial said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""Russia has taken a series of aggressive and destabilizingactions on the global stage and this trip is an opportunity tomake those points clear to the Russian government and what ourexpectations are and see how to forge a path forward."" The official noted that President Donald Trump had stressedthe importance of ""a productive dialogue"" with Russia andfinding ways to cooperate on shared interests. Progress had been made in a number of areas, with engagementon Afghanistan, North Korea and counter-terrorism. The official said the two sides had had constructivediscussions on efforts to persuade North Korea to give up itsnuclear weapons, ""even though we don't agree with Russia aboutall the details of how to achieve this goal."" ""We welcome the positive role of Russia, China and any othercountry in the Afghan peace process,"" he said. Pompeo will fly on Monday to Moscow, where he will meet withU.S. Embassy staff and members of the business community beforeheading to Sochi for talks with Lavrov and Putin on Tuesday. The official declined to forecast concrete outcomes. ""We are approaching this from a very realistic approach,that this is an opportunity to take the conversation to a higherlevel and to have that frank and direct conversation on thisfull range of issues."" The official said the United States was seeking a new era ofarms control with Russia to address ""new and emerging threats""and Pompeo's trip would be an opportunity to discuss that. Trump spoke with Putin by phone last week and said theydiscussed the possibility of a new accord limiting nuclear armsthat could eventually include China in what would be a majordeal between the globe’s top three atomic powers. The 2011 New START treaty, the only U.S.-Russia arms controlpact limiting deployed strategic nuclear weapons, expires inFebruary 2021 but can be extended for five years if both sidesagree. Without the agreement, it could be harder to gauge eachother’s intentions, arms control advocates say. Trump has called the New START treaty concluded by hispredecessor, Barack Obama, a ""bad deal"" and ""one-sided."" Pompeo met Lavrov in Finland this week and raised concernsabout interference in upcoming U.S. elections. A report by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller releasedlast month found Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidentialelection ""in sweeping and systematic fashion,"" favoring Trumpover Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump said last week he discussed ""the Russia Hoax"" in hiscall with Putin but did not raise concerns about further Russianmeddling.(Reporting by David Brunnstrom, Jonathan Landay, Makini Briceand Susan Heavey; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Bill Trott)","UPDATE 2-Pompeo to raise 'aggressive, destabilizing' Russian actions with Putin, Lavrov","pompeo will reiterate u.s. concerns about russia's roles invenezuela and syria and its breach of the intermediate-rangenuclear forces ( inf ) treaty.

"    SINGAPORE, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Asia's 0.5% very low-sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) refining margins and cash premiums edged higher on Wednesday, after falling steadily over the past week     Trade liquidity in Asia's physical and derivatives market for fuel oil was thin amid Lunar New Year celebrations in China and other parts of Asia.     Residual fuel oil inventories in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ) fell 11% to a two-week low in the week to Jan. 27, official data showed.     Residual fuel stocks in Fujairah fell on firm exports to Singapore and improved bunkering demand amid softening bunker prices, trade sources said.              FUJAIRAH STOCKS     - FOIZ inventories for heavy distillates and residues fell 1.344 million barrels (about 212,000 tonnes) from the previous week to 10.45 million barrels (1.646 million tonnes), S&P Global Platts data showed.     - However, the weekly fuel oil inventories at FOIZ were 28% higher compared with year-ago levels.     - Fuel oil stocks at FOIZ averaged 10.82 million barrels (1.70 million tonnes) in 2019, Reuters calculations showed.          TOP OF THE CHARTS      - PetroChina's Singapore bunkering unit moved up a notch to become the top marine fuel supplier in the world's biggest ship refuelling hub in 2019, official data showed, as the overall number of suppliers fell for a sixth year in a row.     - Singapore-based Sentek Marine & Trading Pte Ltd climbed one spot to second position,  while Singapore's Ocean Bunkering Services Pte Ltd fell two places to third.     - Tough market conditions and a crackdown by authorities on industry malpractice reduced the number of licensed bunker suppliers to 45 from 51 a year earlier, the latest data from the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) of Singapore showed.     - The biggest leaps up the MPA's ranking included Plamstone Tankers & Trading Pte Ltd, which rose to 13th place from 34th place a year earlier, while Glencore Singapore jumped 14 places to 7th spot.     - Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd marked the biggest drop, falling to 37th place in 2019 from 17th in 2018.     - Brightoil Petroleum Pte Ltd fell 16 places to 44th, while Exxonmobil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd fell 15 spots to 22nd.          ASIAN MARGINS      - ""Diesel is now pricing below gasoline on a tonne basis in Europe and continues to do so in Asia,"" said JBC Energy in a note on Wednesday. Refiners globally have spent the last year shifting away from light distillates and towards middle distillates, partly in anticipation of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) marine fuel sulphur cap starting 2020, JBC added.      - ""With the prospect of an IMO gasoil spike now long past, a reversal of this yield switch might well be around the corner,"" said JBC.      - ""What is more, VLSFO is also a valuable product. It should continue in the short term to compete at the margin for the residue that might otherwise have been converted into diesel in Europe and Asia,"" said the Vienna-based research consultancy.      - ""On top of that, with VGO still very expensive, we may see additional heavy atmospheric gas oil pushed into FCC units, further tightening up the broader middle distillate pool.""     - IMO rules have capped the sulphur content of ship fuel at 0.5% from the start of 2020 unless vessels are equipped with exhaust-cleaning systems known as scrubbers.          REFINING MIGHT      - China is set to further expand its massive oil refining capacity this year, offering support to global oil prices, and to U.S. producers in particular, but its plans spell more gloom for Asia's hard-hit refining industry.     Already the world's No.2 oil refiner after the United States, China added 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) of capacity last year — 80% of the United Kingdom's refinery throughput — and analysts expect a further 460,000 bpd to become operational in 2020.

"* A look at the day ahead from European Economics and Politics Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views expressed are their own. LONDON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - As Theresa May sets out to today sell her Brexit deal to the country ahead of a crunch Dec. 11 parliamentary vote, it wasn't exactly helpful that Donald Trump said he thought it would make future UK-US trade more difficult. Downing Street immediately rejected that interpretation and pointed out that preparatory work for a future trade pact was already underway. Still, various critics of the deal have jumped on Trump's comments as proof that it is a dud. The first leg of May's nationwide tour today will have her meet politicians, students, academics, community and religious leaders in Northern Ireland and similarly broad spectrum in Wales. Separately in Luxembourg, Europe's top court will hold an urgent hearing on Tuesday over whether Britain can unilaterally reverse its decision to leave the EU - a case supporters of membership hope could pave the way to a second referendum and ultimately stop Brexit. In the end, Italy's leaders stuck with their budget plans in a meeting last night but left open the possibility of eventually cutting its deficit target. Earlier on Monday, two sources had told Reuters the coalition may reduce next year's deficit goal to as low as 2 percent of gross domestic product from the 2.4 percent currently projected in order to avoid disciplinary action from Brussels. There is still wiggle room in the costing and timing of the government's flagship projects - including bringing forward the retirement age and introducing an income support plan for the nation's army of poor and unemployed. So far, there is no formal talk of new sanctions on Russia after its seizure of Ukrainian vessels, but an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel has come out this morning and said he would not rule them out. Norbert Roettgen, a member of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union who chairs the German parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said Russia's behaviour was deeply worrying and that tougher sanctions were an option. Merkel herself has stressed the need for dialogue while the European Union, Britain, France, Poland, Denmark, and Canada all condemned what they called Russian aggression. For now, the rouble has rebounded somewhat after its falls yesterday on sanctions fears. Today, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is due to meet his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian in Paris. Some of the Ukrainian sailors on board the vessels are scheduled to appear in a Crimean court at around 1100 GMT. MARKETS AT 0755 GMT Not for the first time, U.S. President Donald Trump has thrown a curve ball into world markets – with his overnight Wall Street Journal interview jarring Chinese stocks, the yuan, Apple shares, U.S. stock futures and even sterling. Despite some hopes of a easing of Sino-U.S. trade tensions at this week’s critical G20 summit in Argentina, Trump said he expects to raise U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent on Jan 1 as planned and only further opening up of Chinese markets to competition would lead to some sort of deal. While Shanghai stocks lost all their early gains to trade slightly in the red by the close, losses in U.S. and European stock futures were briefly reversed in early European trade after a report that Chinese officials indicated some compromise might indeed be on the table. The S&P500 had gained 1.5 percent on Monday before the WSJ interview. In the newspaper article, Trump added that the next round of tariffs on $267 billion of goods not already sanctioned could hit laptops and Apple’s iPhone imported from China. Apple’s shares fell nearly 2 percent in extended trading late Monday. On Brexit, Trump criticised UK PM Theresa May’s deal with the European Union – for which she is currently struggling to gain domestic support ahead of a pivotal Dec 11 parliamentary vote – and said the agreement as it stands might not allow the UK to seek a direct trade deal with the United States and that was not what the UK had ""meant"". Sterling fell against the dollar to its lowest level since Nov. 16 and slipped against the euro. too. Italian sovereign bond yields remained lower after Monday’s drop amid signals from Rome it was prepared to compromise with the EU on lowering its 2.4 percent budget deficit target for next year, if not the main pillars of that expansionary budget – namely the citizens income and pension reform. Russia’s rouble bounced 0.6 percent, clawing back half of the previous day’s losses, when investors sold Russian assets after escalating military tensions between Kiev and Moscow. However, there are some indications the latest developments will add to pressure for fresh sanctions on Moscow, with an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying Europe may have to do so. In corporate news, Thomas Cook shares fell more than 20 percent at the open after the travel firm cut its earnings forecast for the second time in two months. * Europe corp events: Intertek trading, Pennon, UDG Healthcare, Seadrill Q3, De La Rue HY, Pets at Home HY, Topps Tiles FY * France Nov consumer confidence * Italy Nov consumer/business confidence * ECB board member Mersch speaks in Luxembourg * UK CBI Nov distributive trades survey * Bank of England chief Carney in Q&A in London on future of money * China’s President Xi visits Spain * Portugal Q3 GDP * Sweden Oct trade balance, PPI * US Q3 earnings:  Evoqua Water, Rockwell Collins, Nutanix, salesforce.com * US Nov consumer confidence * Mexico Oct trade balance * Chicago Fed chief Evans and Atlanta Fed chief Bostic speak in NYC * US Treasury auctions 5-year notes (Editing by Larry King)",MORNING BID EUROPE-Brexit deal on tour: Dec 11 countdown,theresa may sets out to sell her brexit deal to the country ahead of a crunch dec. 11 parliamentary vote. europe's top court will hold an urgent hearing on t tuesday over whether britain can unilaterally reverse its decision to leave the eu. italy's leaders stuck with their budget plans in a meeting last night but left open the possibility of eventually cutting its deficit target. there is no formal talk of new sanctions on russia after its seizure of ukrainian vessels.,"morning bid europe-brexit , italy and russia : the day ahead"

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days. SIMPLIFIED: Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

"BEIJING, July 30 (Reuters) - The city of Changzhou in Jiangsu province is planning to implement production curbs in heavy industry, the latest case of Chinese cities scrambling to cut emissions as part of Beijing's intensified anti-pollution campaign. The city has issued a draft plan ordering steel mills, copper smelters, chemical makers and cement producers to shut down or cut production by as much as 50 percent by Aug. 3 at the latest, according to a city government document reviewed by Reuters. ""It is not sure when the output curbs will last...probably until the end of this year,"" told Yu Le, an official at Changzhou Environmental Bureau, to Reuters on the phone, who confirmed the authenticity of the document. Jiangsu is China's second-largest steelmaking province. Yu said the draft plan has been submitted to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment for review and some adjustments might be made after the city receives a response. ""Rates of production curbs are based on the operation situations and emission levels at companies and will be adjusted dynamically,"" said the draft plan. The draft plans follows Beijing's push to adopt a more nuanced and ""scientific"" approach when it comes to curbing emissions from polluting firms as the country vowed to make the measures more efficient in order to meet the politically crucial targets. More than 400 companies in Changzhou will have to enforce the compulsory production cuts though rates will vary. Changzhou, home to steel mills and steel processing firms, mainly pipeline makers, produced 12.96 million tonnes of crude steel last year, accounting for 1.6 percent of the country's total steel output. Earlier this month, China's top steelmaking city Tangshan in Hebei province ordered steel mills, coke producers and utilities to deepen output curbs for six weeks this summer in order to clear smog in one of the country's most polluted areas. Meanwhile, most of the steel firms in the city of Xuzhou, also in Jiangsu, remain shut due to environmental reasons. Concerns over tight supplies in the market drove steel prices to a 5-1/2 year high on Monday.

"THE HAGUE, March 11 (Reuters) - Former Congolese vicepresident and militia leader Jean-Pierre Bemba, who wasacquitted of war crimes by the International Criminal Court(ICC) last year, is seeking nearly 70 million euros ($75 milliondollars) in damages. Bemba's lawyers on Monday said paperwork had been filedrequesting compensation for unlawful detention, legal fees andlosses due to the alleged mismanagement of assets seized by thecourt. The assets included seven airplanes, three villas inPortugal, three parcels of land in the Democratic Republic ofCongo and two boats, said his lawyer, Peter Haynes. During 10 years in detention, Bemba’s assets ""were simplyallowed to rot"", Haynes told journalists in The Hague. The claim totals just under half of the ICC’s annual budgetof some 150 million euros. No date was set for when the filingwould be considered. Defendants have sought damages from the court in the pastfor unlawful detention, but none were awarded. A court spokesmansaid the filing in the Bemba case would be considered by thejudges and had no additional comment.

"(Repeats Sunday's story without changes) By Marc Jones LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Financial markets need to gird for a lengthy spell of turbulence as more of the world's top central banks begin shutting down stimulus programmes and raising interest rates, the Bank for International Settlements said in its latest report. A decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers ignited the global banking crisis, the Switzerland-based central bank umbrella group likened this year's market volatility to the reaction of a patient coming off strong medicine. There could be more turbulence ahead with U.S. rates likely to keep rising, trade war worries escalating, the European Central Bank about to end its money printing programme and troubled emerging markets having to jack up interest rates. ""Policymakers and markets should brace themselves for a lengthy and eventful convalescence,"" the head of the BIS' Monetary and Economic Department, Claudio Borio, warned. The sell-off in emerging markets since the end of January has already matched the one seen five years ago during the 'taper tantrum' when investors first freaked out about life without U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus. That proved a short-term bump for markets, but the BIS sees this episode as having a slower burning fuse, the length of which will partially hinge on whether recessions start to hit as some economists now fear. Central banks are expected to tread carefully. The imminent end to the ECB's 2.5 trillion euro bond buying plan will be cushioned as it recycles the profits for years, while the Bank of Japan lags even further behind in the process. But there is still plenty for markets to fret about. Wall Street equity prices have been stretched even further, reaching new historical peaks. Volatility has stayed low and bond market 'term premia' has remained highly compressed. Credit spreads for riskier 'high-yield' companies have been hovering around levels that prevailed just before the 2007-08 global financial crisis (GFC). DROWNING IN DEBT The BIS' report issued its regular warning about the immense amount of dollar and other foreign currency debt built up by emerging markets, as well as crypto currencies and 'zombie' firms whose earnings don't cover interest payments. EM currencies have tumbled like dominoes this year as the dollar charged higher on the back of higher U.S. interest rates, a strengthening U.S. economy and trade war concerns. U.S. dollar lending to emerging markets not including banks has more than doubled since the financial crash to some $3.7 trillion. And these figures do not include any borrowing through FX swaps, which could easily be of a similar order of magnitude. ""Ironically, too much debt was at the heart of the crisis, and now we have more of it,"" Borio said. The BIS report also contained a timely study on the exposure of economies and banks around the world to Turkey, which has been one of the focal points of the emerging market stress this year. According to data which covers the period to the end of March this year, foreign banks had $223 billion in outstanding loans, securities holdings and other claims vis-à-vis Turkey residents. The BIS noted that Belgian banks' claims on Turkey at less than $1 billion, for example, were much smaller than those of German banks at nearly $13 billion. But relative to total capital, the two banking systems had similar exposures at 2.3 percent and 2.4 percent respectively.

"Oct 30 (Reuters) - Shares of Canada's Maple Leaf Foods Inc tumbled 13% on Wednesday as the packaged meat producer missed estimates for quarterly profit, hurt by a temporary ban on Canadian pork exports to China and heavy investments in plant-based meat products. Canada's lucrative pork trade has taken a hit after China earlier this year asked the Canadian government to temporarily stop shipping meat to the country after bogus pork export certificates were discovered. (https://reut.rs/33bY24Q) Hog prices have been volatile this year due to U.S-China trade tensions and an outbreak of African swine fever, a deadly pig disease that has killed millions of animals in China, the world's biggest consumer of pork. Maple Leaf said the ban hurt its gross profit in its meat protein business. ""Meat protein faced an unexpectedly erratic market condition in the quarter connected with global trade, and we expect that to reverse in short order,"" said Chief Executive Officer Michael McCain in a statement. The Toronto-based pork processor's profit was also hit by increased investments in meat alternatives, which are becoming increasingly popular with health-conscious consumers. Net income almost halved to C$13.4 million ($10.19 million) in three months ended Sept.30. Excluding items, the company earned 3 Canadian cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate of 31 Canadian cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

"* Markets up on oil surge * Expected GCC support for Bahrain adds momentum * Saudi REITs best performers boosted by retail buyers * Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair drops on profits * Eshraq Properties shines in Abu Dhabi By Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, July 1 (Reuters) - Gulf stock markets closed in positive territory on Sunday, boosted by a surge in oil prices, an increase in retail investors and encouraging news on Bahrain's financial prospects. Oil prices surged last week on concerns that U.S. sanctions against Iran would remove a substantial volume of crude oil from world markets at a time of rising global demand. Bahrain’s bonds and currency rebounded from multi-year lows late last week after Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates said in a joint statement that they would announce soon measures to support its economy. The Bahraini index closed 0.2 percent up on Sunday. It climbed 0.9 percent since last week’s announcement from the country’s regional allies. The Saudi index gained 0.3 percent, with petrochemical companies rising on the back of higher oil prices, and with real estate investment trust funds posting large gains of up to 10 percent. The best performer was Al Jazira Mawten REIT, up 9.9 percent, followed by Taleem REIT Fund, which jumped 9 percent. A fund manager said an increase of retail investors participating in the Saudi market over the last week could have pushed REIT valuations up, given that REIT stocks are generally speculative and attract high-yield seekers. Lifted by surging oil prices, petchem companies such as Saudi Kayan Petrochemical Co. and Sahara Petrochemical Co. gained 1.3 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. The worst performer was Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair Co. , with stocks in the Saudi retailer plunging 6.4 percent after the company reported its annual financial results late last week. Net profit for the year ending on March 31 2018 declined 76 percent, to 103.5 million riyals from 425.3 million riyals the previous year, it said. Stock exchanges were up across the region, with the Dubai index and the Abu Dhabi index up 1.5 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. In Abu Dhabi, Eshraq Properties jumped 6.7 percent. The company said last week it was seeking to deploy ""excess liquidity"" in investments across the United Arab Emirates, after dropping merger plans with Abu Dhabi developer Reem Investments. It also said it has no exposure to Dubai's private equity Abraaj Group. In Dubai, most stocks were up but trading volume was concentrated on Drake & Scull (DSI), which shed 0.7 percent after some gains earlier on Sunday. Over the past two months, shares in the contractor have been dropping, going down to their lowest level ever, as retail investors offloaded them amid concerns about DSI’s business outlook and an investigation into its former management team. The company said in a bourse filing last week that the recent sell-off of its shares was not related to any major news. Outside of the Gulf, the Egyptian exchange was closed because of a national holiday. SAUDI ARABIA * The index climbed 0.3 percent to 8,340 points. DUBAI * The index gained 1.5 percent to 2,864 points. ABU DHABI * The index jumped 1.3 percent to 4,621 points. QATAR * The index rose 1 percent to 9,114 points. KUWAIT * The index added 0.2 percent to 4,915 points. BAHRAIN * The index increased 0.2 percent to 1,314 points. OMAN * The index plunged 4.9 percent to 4,347 points.

"* New restructure programme to bring job cuts, plantclosures * Difficult few years for autos industry ahead * Schaeffler to cut dependency on products for combustionengine * Will innovate to supply electric vehicles * Shares down nearly 8 pct(Adds CEO comments, shares drop) By Alexander Hübner FRANKFURT, March 6 (Reuters) - German bearings makerSchaeffler said it would cut 900 jobs, shut plantsand reduce its product range after its 2018 earnings slumped dueto weak demand in Europe and China and it warned of achallenging few years ahead for the autos sector. Its shares traded 8.5 percent weaker on Wednesday, after thecompany, which also supplies bearings to industry, announced anew restructuring programme, RACE, which would cost 60 millioneuros ($67.81 million) in 2019. Chief Executive Klaus Rosenfeld described it as ""braking andaccelerating at the same time"", as the programme aims to improveearnings by approximately 90 million euros, or the EBIT marginby 100 basis points, in its initial phase. ""We anticipate that the environment, especially in theglobal automotive business, will remain extremely demanding andchallenging. At the same time, we expect the global economy toslow down further,"" he said. Schaeffler said 2018 adjusted earnings before interest andtaxes fell 13 percent to 1.38 billion euros, while revenue rose3.9 percent. It expects revenue to grow by 1-3 percent in 2019and sees an EBIT margin before special items of 8-9 percent. Rosenfeld said it would not be smart to announce newmid-term targets at the moment. Lower growth for Schaeffler's automotive branch in thesecond half of 2018 was due to weaker demand in Europe followingnew emissions standards and the trade conflict with the UnitedStates which hurt orders from China. Adding to the gloomy outlook for the industry, small-capSwiss autos supplier Autoneum, which makes heat andnoise reduction components, fell 9.3 percent after reporting adrop in profitability. It is struggling to turn around itsloss-making U.S. business and recoup investments in China. ELECTRIC FUTURE Schaeffler is especially vulnerable to the shift to electricvehicles, which use practically no bearings, unlike thecombustion engine. ""We want to further reduce the large extent to which we relyon the internal combustion engine while - being an innovativetechnology partner to our customers - utilising theopportunities offered by the fields of hybridization andelectrification much more extensively,"" Rosenfeld said. ""We started later in electric mobility than others did, butwe are working now to catch up."" The company dropped out of the German midcap index (Mdax) onTuesday after its market capitalisation almost halved withinnine months. Rosenfeld added Schaeffler did not belong to thesmall-caps index and he would do whatever it takes to return tothe Mdax.

"By Rina Chandran BANGKOK, Sept 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thai campaigners have criticised a pilot programme that allows villagers to live in the forest as long as they care for the environment, arguing that it does not give land tenure security. More than 50,000 residents of 22 villages who live in the forests of the northern province of Loei will not be evicted or penalised if they agree to protect the forest under the newly launched Land Allocation scheme, officials said. Conditions include reserving a fifth of the land for planting trees, and reducing their use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, said environment minister Surasak Karnjanarat. ""Only communities with a proven track record of protecting the forest will be allowed to stay,"" Surasak told reporters. ""This is a new approach to community management - villagers and officials must work together to protect the forest. Forcing them from the forest is not the right decision,"" he said. Indigenous and local communities own more than half the world's land under customary rights. Yet they only have secure legal rights to 10 percent, according to Washington D.C.-based advocacy group Rights and Resources Initiative. Thailand's campaigners have long called for amending the 1961 National Park Act to protect villagers and indigenous people from being evicted from land they consider theirs by birthright, because of disputes over ownership. Campaigners say evictions have risen since the military government passed a forest reclamation order in 2014, which authorities say is essential for conservation. The Forest Allocation scheme does not grant ownership rights, so there is no security of tenure, said Wiron Ruchichaiwat, a community organiser in Loei province. ""We have always cared for the forest. Now, we have to prove we have always lived here, and do what the officials ask us to do - and even then there is no guarantee we will not be evicted,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Wednesday. ""Instead, the government should give us a collective title."" Officials have delayed granting collective titling, say campaigners who led street protests earlier this year, demanding rights to forest dwellers and an end to industrial projects on farmland. Thailand's Cabinet has passed a draft Community Forest Bill which also encourages public participation in managing forests. More than 3 million families could benefit from the programme, which will cover more than 2.5 million hectares (9,653 sq miles) of land, officials said. But it only covers reserve forests, and not national parks, from where villagers are being evicted, campaigners say. (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran. Editing by Jared Ferrie.

"(Repeats Monday story without changes) * Italy hires banks for new 15-yr bond deal * Sale to follow strong syndicated debt deals in early 2019 * Investors say would look at new Italy deal * Spain also expected to sell bonds via a syndicate in Jan By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Record investor demand for theyear's first wave of euro zone government bond sales sets thestage for new debt issuance from Italy and Spain, whose debtagencies are keen to capitalise on the conducive environment,bankers said. Italy announced on Monday that it has hired a syndicate ofbanks to sell a new 15-year bond to be launched soon, subject tomarket conditions. Spain is expected to follow with a syndicated bond nextweek, bankers told Reuters, following similar issues fromBelgium, Ireland and Portugal which raised a combined 14 billioneuros last week. Those sales drew huge demand from internationalfund managers, generating a total 70 billion euros of orders. Smaller euro zone countries have traditionally usedsyndication to broaden the investor base for their bonds andcompete with larger countries whose debt attracts demand becauseof its benchmark status. Bigger peers like Italy meanwhile use syndication to targetparticular groups, such as international or retail investors, orto conduct long-dated bond sales that may struggle to gaintraction at auction. Adding in bond auctions, euro zone governments last weekraised almost 40 billion euros, according to Commerzbank. Such heavy supply is typical of early January, whenborrowers try to take advantage of fund managers' desire to putmoney to work. The sales also come after a volatile end to 2018and as signs of decelerating world -- and euro zone -- growthmake government bonds more attractive to investors. Italy's offering is likely to attract scrutiny because ofthe turbulence in its assets last year. Italy last completed a syndicated deal in January 2018,selling a 20-year bond. That was before a populist governmentcame to power in the summer, sapping appetite for Italian bonds. ""They need to be very sure that they are going to get thesort of international demand they need to get one of those largesyndications over the line,"" said one banker, who managed someof last week's deals and who asked to remain anonymous. Sentiment towards Italy has improved since it agreed to cutits deficit target for 2019 -- reflected by successful auctionslast week -- but investors might hold out for extra yield overItaly's existing issues. Christel Rendu de Lint, head of fixed income at UnionBancaire Privée, which has 128.4 billion Swiss francs ($130.71billion) of assets under management, said her fund may use theissue to change its cautious stance on Italy. ""We actually got out of Italian debt in May last year whenwe first got a hint that there might be a 5-Star/Leaguecoalition and we have stayed out of that market ever since. Butthis upcoming syndication might actually be an opportunity toget back into it,"" she said. Other investors told Reuters they would consider investingin a new Italian issue. Italy's outstanding August 3034 bondwas trading at a yield of 3.35 percent on Monday, a292 bps premium over the equivalent July 2034 German Bund. ""Even with the recent spread tightening, yields arerelatively attractive for insurance firms and long-terminvestors so the sale should go well,"" said Patrick O'Donnell,an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. Roberto Coronado, a portfolio manager for PinebridgeInvestments, agreed that Italy was attractively priced. ""I think 250 bps over (German) Bunds is where fair valuewould be and at the moment we are getting a bit extra,"" he said,referring to 10-year debt. AND SPAIN? Italy and Spain typically raise 6-9 billion euros each yearapiece via syndicated bond sales. France may also be a candidate to sell debt in January as ittargets a 2019 borrowing requirement of nearly 237 billioneuros, while Greece may finally bring a long-awaited 10-yearsyndication, bankers said. ""Spain in particular will be very encouraged by the demandfrom last week, especially the Portugal trade, and I wouldn'texpect them to hang about,"" said the banker. Spain is enjoying strong growth and an improving creditprofile, while still offering healthy returns. Spanish 10-yearbonds yield 1.42 percent and pay a 122 basis pointpremium over German debt. ""Spain and Portugal both look like reasonably safe places toput your money, but you are still getting paid a premium forit,"" said Rendu de Lint at UBP. ""That's the attraction, especially at a time when we havebeen running low 'credit' risk across our portfolios.""

"By Karl Plume and Hallie Gu CHICAGO/BEIJING, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Chinese importers have been busy booking fresh purchases of soybeans from Brazil this week, despite the White House announcement that China had agreed to buy up to $50 billion of U.S. farm products annually during trade talks last week. Two traders said China has booked at least eight boatloads, or 480,000 tonnes worth $173 million, of Brazilian soybeans since Monday. While Brazil is China's largest soybean supplier, large purchases from Brazil are unusual at this time of year. The lack of purchases from the United States so far this week shows China is in no hurry to buy U.S. products in the wake of last week's phase one trade agreement, that U.S. President Donald Trump hopes will be signed next month. Trump said on Twitter on Sunday that China has already begun making U.S. agricultural purchases. But three U.S. soybean exporters said there have been no U.S. sales to China since last week's talks in Washington, and none have been confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ""I've not had any inquiries at all for U.S. (shipments),"" said one of the U.S. soybean exporters. ""There were a few November boats bought from Brazil and several new-crop South American boats for March forward but nothing here."" Another U.S. exporter said a drop in Brazilian soybean prices sparked fresh demand from commercial soy importers that have been unable to profitably import American soybeans for more than a year unless given tariff waivers. State-owned firms COFCO and Sinograin, which are exempt from the 25% retaliatory duties on U.S. imports, have ""little appetite"" to buy unless U.S. prices drop further, the second U.S. exporter said. Before the trade war, China imported most of its U.S. soy between October and January, turning to South America around February. Prices for U.S. soybeans loaded at Gulf Coast terminals in November and December and shipped to China are now near par with Brazilian soy prices. But when prices for soybeans from the two top suppliers are similar, Chinese importers tend to favor Brazilian beans due to their higher average protein content. Chinese importer Hopefull Grain & Oil bought 10 cargoes of Brazilian soy last week ahead of U.S.-China talks and at least 3 cargoes this week, two of the trade sources said. Wilmar was also a buyer, with about 5 to 6 cargoes purchased from Brazil this week, according to a U.S. exporter and two traders, one of whom was based in Beijing while the other worked for a Chinese trading house. Both Hopefull and Wilmar declined to comment. The companies are believed to have used up their waivers for tariff-free U.S. purchases in recent waves of buying, a U.S. exporter and a Chinese importer said. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow acknowledged on Thursday that China's ""serious commitment"" to buy up to $50 billion of agricultural products would depend in part on private companies and market conditions.

"* 12-24 months for Lloyd's marine segment to return toprofit * 10 Lloyd's syndicates have withdrawn or cut marinebusiness * Marine cargo rates are up 12-14% this year - MS Amlin * Yacht rates have risen by at least 20% - sources By Carolyn Cohn, Jonathan Saul and Suzanne Barlyn LONDON/NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - Rivals to Lloyd's ofLondon are riding a rising tide of marine insurance rates,leaving the 330-year-old market behind after it jettisonedsections of its oldest line of business last year. Premiums for marine insurance, which until 2018 had fallenfor years due to rising competition and lower claims, areincreasing after a surge in catastrophe losses in the past twoyears and growing geopolitical tensions.. For Lloyd's, still reeling from two years of losses due tothe heavy claims from natural disasters, it will still take12-24 months before the segment returns to profit, ChiefExecutive John Neal told Reuters in New York last week. Neal said that although the sector had performed better inthe first quarter, syndicates needed to set ""the right price""for the risks and consider whether all types of marine businesswere insurable after Lloyd's told its 99 members to cut theworst 10% of their business last year. Broker Gallagher said in a February report that 10 Lloyd'ssyndicates have withdrawn or reduced their marine business. Thathas benefited the smaller London company market, which operatesseparately in the City. ""We are definitely seeing business from Lloyd's comingthrough our door,"" said a senior London company market insurer. Marine cargo rates are up 12-14% this year, Miles Taffs,head of marine and aviation at Lloyd's for MS Amlin, said, whilesources say yacht rates have risen by at least 20%, and bytriple digits in some locations. ""The (London) company market has demonstrated greaterflexibility in its approach, as have other European markets,particularly France and Scandinavia,"" Alexander Mott, marinedirector at broker AFL, said. The Standard Syndicate at Lloyd's no longer writes newbusiness, while other firms have moved. Norwegian marine insurerSkuld said it will close its Lloyd's syndicate in July, andswitch the business to Oslo and the London company market. AMERICAN REVOLUTION Against this backdrop, Asia Pacific and North Americaninsurers have won business in marine cargo, said a spokeswomanfor the International Union of Marine Insurance, which saidglobal marine insurance premiums totalled $28.5 billion in 2017. And the United States and Scandinavia have also gained fromthe move away from Lloyd's, Carl Day, vice president, property,marine and energy at CNA Hardy, which pulled out of marine hullinsurance last year, said. Although marine insurance slipped to 7% of business atLloyd's in 2018, down from 8% a decade ago, it remains biggerthan energy, motor or aviation. Lloyd's, which started life providing shipping informationand insured ships during the American Revolution and theNapoleonic Wars, has a huge chunk of that market. Its marine insurance and reinsurance gross written premiumstotalled 3.8 billion pounds ($4.85 billion) in 2017, nearlydouble comparable business in the London company market, theInternational Underwriting Association said. But the IUA is compiling premiums data for the Londoncompany market for 2018 and has so far seen a rise in business,including in marine, a spokesman said. While Lloyd's is still dominant in the market, it cannotafford to take its historic strength for granted.

"MOSCOW, Oct 5 (Reuters) - A Russian Deputy Prime Minister in charge of agriculture has proposed the creation of a grain organisation along the lines of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Interfax news agency reported on Saturday, citing his office. Russia, the world's largest wheat exporter, is one of the world's largest oil producers, but is not a member of OPEC. Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeyev is a veteran of the Russian farm sector who has periodically lobbied for the creation of a ""grain OPEC"" in previous years. He was agriculture minister for 10 years until 2009. His remarks on Saturday are the first time he has returned to the idea in public since he came back to the government in 2018. In previous years, his idea of a grain cartel was aimed at the Black Sea producers - Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan - but never gained momentum because Russia joined the World Trade Organization in 2012. WTO rules are designed to stop its member countries from interfering with imports and exports in a way that disrupts trade or discriminates against other members. The world's leading grain exporters could form the OPEC-like group, Gordeyev said at a meeting with German Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner in Cologne on Saturday, Interfax reported. The ""grain OPEC"" would aim to ensure stability on the grain market, coordinate price policy and solve world hunger problems and might include Russia, the European Union, the United States, Canada, and Argentina, among others, Gordeyev told the meeting, according to Interfax.

"By Giulia Paravicini KINSHASA, March 8 (Reuters) - The party of Congo's formerpresident Joseph Kabila will choose the prime minister andnegotiate over cabinet appointments under a power-sharing dealwith his successor Felix Tshisekedi, sources in both theirparties said on Friday. The two parties announced loose plans to form a coalitiongovernment on Wednesday, nearly two months after Tshisekedi tookoffice in Democratic Republic of Congo's first transfer power atthe ballot box since independence in 1960. The announcement suggests that Kabila is likely to remain ahighly influential figure in Congolese politics, despite givingup the presidency after 18 years in power. It will also further fuel the suspicions of those who allegethe pair struck a deal to rig the Dec. 30 election inTshisekedi's favour. Opposition candidate Martin Fayulu rejected the results as asham, an assertion supported by Congo's Catholic Church, whichdeployed 40,000 observers to the polls. African and Westernnations initially expressed doubts about the outcome beforeaccepting it. Concurrent legislative polls gave Kabila's Common Front forCongo (FCC) coalition 342 of parliament's 485 seats. ""Clearly, considering the striking majority we obtained, theprime minister will be designated by the FCC,"" Julien Lubunga, aKabila advisor, told Reuters by phone on Friday. ""Theministries' negotiations are ongoing, and I expect a governmentby the end of March."" Congo's constitution dictates that the prime minister mustcome from the majority in parliament, but normally the presidentmakes the final decision on who will fill the post. Tshisekedi's Common Front for Congo only obtained around 50seats, making it impossible for the coalition to govern withoutthe support of Kabila's FCC. Through its control of parliament,the FCC can also maintain significant influence over thecountry's finances and security apparatus. The two leaders have met at least twice in recent weeks todiscuss the power-sharing agreement, once at Kabila's farm andonce at Tshiskedi's temporary residence in the capital,Kinshasa. Their parties issued a statement Wednesday sayingthat, to reflect the will of the Congolese people, they intendto ""govern together as part of a coalition."" Kabila wants to retain control over key ministries such asdefence, foreign affairs and finance, a concession Tshisekedi'scoalition is not ready to make, according to officials in bothcamps involved in the negotiations. ""They will pick the prime minister,"" said a source close toTshisekedi.

"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Colombo-July 12: Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed AMW Capital Leasing And Finance PLC's (AMWCL)National Long-Term Rating at 'BBB+(lka)'. The Outlook is Stable. Key Rating Drivers AMWCL's rating reflects Fitch's expectationthat support would be forthcomingfrom Associated Motorways Private Limited (AMW), which owns 90% of AMWCL, inlight of the finance company's strategic importance to its parent, a largeimporter of motor vehicles in Sri Lanka. This is based on AMWCL's role in thegroup, the common AMW brand and reputational risk for AMW if AMWCL defaulted. Fitch sees the synergies between the two companies as high, since almost half ofAMWCL's advances comprise facilities that are provided to clients who purchaseAMW products. AMW set up AMWCL in 2006 with the objective of supporting its corebusiness. AMW is involved in the strategic direction of AMWCL through boardrepresentation. AMWCL has nine of its 22 branches based within AMW branches. Rating Sensitivities AMWCL's rating is sensitive to changes in Fitch's assessment of its parent'sability and propensity to provide support, none of which Fitch expects to changesignificantly in the short to medium term.

"(Adds U.S. State Department comment) SEOUL/MADRID, March 28 (Reuters) - A shadowy dissident groupaccused of breaking into North Korea's embassy in Madrid lastmonth said on Thursday it was temporarily suspending operations,after a Spanish judge issued international arrest warrants fortwo suspects Spanish authorities say fled to the United States. Cheollima Civil Defense, also known as Free Joseon,acknowledged on its website late on Tuesday it was behind theFeb. 22 incident but said it was not an attack and that thegroup had been invited into the embassy. In a statement on the website on Thursday, Cheollima CivilDefense said that while it has ""bigger tasks ahead,"" it hadtemporarily suspended work because of ""speculative"" mediareports. ""We ask the media to restrain itself in its interest in ourorganization and its members,"" the statement said, noting thatthe group's membership includes North Korean refugees, but thatit had not recently contacted defectors living in South Korea. A Spanish judicial source said on Wednesday that warrantswere issued for the group's alleged leader and another suspectafter a Spanish court investigation found that they had brokeninto the embassy, tried to persuade an official to defect andthen stolen computer equipment. The suspected leader has been identified by the court asAdrian Hong Chang, a Mexican citizen who is a U.S. resident. The other suspect sought in the arrest warrant is Sam Ryu,a U.S. citizen of Korean descent. According to a Spanish court document made public onTuesday, Hong Chang traveled to the United States a day afterthe raid and contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation topass on information about it. The FBI has declined to comment officially on anyinvestigation, but an authoritative U.S. government source saidon Wednesday that it had received the names of the allegedembassy intruders from Spanish investigators and was lookinginto the matter at the request of Spanish authorities. According to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, investigatorshave linked two of the attackers to the CIA. The U.S. State Department said earlier there was no U.S.government involvement in the attack and a U.S. governmentofficial said on Thursday that the CIA had had ""no contact atall"" with any of the individuals mentioned in the Spanishindictment. ""The Spanish authorities are still investigating this. Allfacts are not known,"" State Department spokesman RobertPalladino said at a regular briefing on Thursday, reiteratingthe U.S. position that diplomatic missions ""ought to berespected and are protected by treaty."" Asked whether the United States was assisting in the searchfor the suspects, he told reporters it was a ""law enforcementmatter"" and that the State Department had no information toprovide. The White House declined to comment. Spanish judicial sources told Reuters the two arrestwarrants were likely to be the first of several as there werebelieved to have been 10 intruders. The other suspects include South Korean citizens. According to the Spanish court document, Hong Chang flewfrom Lisbon to New York after the raid and made contact with theFBI on Feb. 27. His current whereabouts are not known and efforts to contacthim were not successful. Analysts say Hong is a longtime activist who helped found arefugee aid organization, Liberty in North Korea (LiNK), andlater led an organization preparing for an ""imminent, dramaticchange"" in North Korea. Lee Wolosky, an American attorney who represents CheollimaCivil Defense, said in a statement on Wednesday that the Spanishcourt ""purported to reach conclusions without any input fromrepresentatives"" of the group. He said it was irresponsible ""to disclose publicly the namesof people who are working in opposition to a brutal regime thatroutinely and summarily executes its enemies."" The embassy raid occurred shortly before a Feb. 27-28 summitbetween North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. PresidentDonald Trump in Hanoi. According to the court document, during the raid, three ofthe intruders, who identified themselves as members of a groupwho campaigned for the ""liberation of North Korea"", took anembassy official into the basement and tried to convince him todefect. The group kept embassy staff tied up for several hours andthen searched the premises for arms before leaving, at whichpoint they separated into four groups and headed to Portugal,the document said. The document gave a detailed account of the intruders'movements before and during the intrusion, including their stayin a hotel and purchases of knives, balaclava masks and fakeguns.(Reporting by Josh Smith in SEOUL, Belén Carreño and IslaBinnie in Madrid, additional reporting by Mark Hosenball, DavidBrunnstrom, Matt Spetalnick, Lesley Wroughton and JonathanLanday in Washington; Editing by James Dalgleish and SandraMaler)",UPDATE 3-Dissident group accused of N.Korean embassy intrusion suspends operations,"a spanish judge issued international arrest warrants for two suspects spanish authorities say fled to the united states. cheollima civil defense, also known as free joseon, acknowledged it was behind the incident but said it was not an attack. the group's membership includes north korean refugees, but that it had not recently contacted defectors living in south korea.",update 3-n.korean dissident group suspends work after spanish arrest warrants issued for embassy intruders

"By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, Oct 28 (Reuters) - In 2013, Netflix Inc shook up television by delivering 13 episodes of ""House of Cards"" in one batch, a move that helped popularize streaming video and fueled a culture of binge watching. But Apple Inc, Walt Disney Co and AT&T Inc are largely rejecting that path as they prepare their own efforts to hook the online audiences that embraced Netflix. Executives at AT&T's forthcoming HBO Max, a streaming service that will be unveiled to investors on Tuesday, plan to debut one new episode of its original series per week, Robert Greenblatt, chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment and the company's direct-to-consumer business, told Reuters. That mirrors the traditional TV pattern. ""We like the idea that people watch weekly and look forward to the next episode and talk about it,"" Greenblatt said. ""Newspapers write about the storylines. There is a sense of a shared experience."" Creating buzz around a new series will be crucial in the coming weeks and months as several companies jockey to lure customers and keep them paying a monthly fee over the long term. HBO Max may make some exceptions, according to a source familiar with the company's strategy, by putting out a few episodes simultaneously to stoke initial interest. Apple, meanwhile, will debut its subscription video service, Apple TV+, on Friday. For dramas ""The Morning Show"" and ""See,"" and most other Apple series, the company will drop three episodes at the same time, followed by one per week. The family-friendly Disney+ will unveil episodes weekly for new series including ""The Mandalorian,"" the first live-action TV show set in the ""Star Wars"" universe. Disney+ will launch on Nov. 12. 'WAIT AND EXPERIENCE' ""Mandalorian"" star Pedro Pascal said he believes the once-a-week approach will make watching the show ""more romantic and more classic."" ""Basically you get to sort of wait and experience more collectively, and it just makes it more event television, which it deserves to be,"" Pascal said. ""A little courtship never hurt anyone,"" added co-star Gina Carano. But to some viewers, going a week after a dramatic cliffhanger ""seems like it's old school,"" said Brett Sappington, principal analyst at Parks Associates. ""For some consumers, that can be frustrating,"" he said. ""Expectations are just different today."" While it started among younger viewers, binge viewing of several episodes is now common among all age groups, Sappington said. It also has been adopted by audiences around the world. In surveys by Ampere Analysis, 69 percent of people in the United States said they frequently watch several episodes of the same TV show back to back. The percentage was 66 percent in Britain, 65 percent in France and 46 percent in Germany. SPIKING AT DEBUT Various release strategies can generate hits, according to data from Parrot Analytics, which measures global demand for programming. It found interest in binge-able series generally spikes when they debut and then tapers off, while shows released weekly see interest build over time. Both level off around 10 to 12 weeks. HBO's ""Euphoria,"" for example, released its first installment in June at the same time that Netflix dropped the entire season of ""The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance."" Global demand for ""Dark Crystal"" peaked in the first week after it premiered, while ""Euphoria"" saw steady increases after each episode came out, according to Parrot Analytics. It reached its highest point around the episode eight finale. Both shows peaked with roughly 18 million daily ""demand expressions,"" a combination of viewership, social media mentions and online research about the shows. Even Netflix is experimenting with intervals between episodes. For reality competition ""Rhythm + Flow,"" the company released four installments at first, three more a week later, and the final three a week after that. Around the world, Netflix distributes roughly 35 shows on a once-a-week basis, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in October during the company's earnings webcast. While it does not release audience figures for most of its programming, Sarandos said Netflix customers preferred getting all episodes together. ""We actually get more viewing and cumulatively more social media buzz, more tweets, more activity on social media, around these shows for the all-at-once model,"" Sarandos said.

"(Adding details, BDI, DIHK, Maas and Merkel's conservatives comments) BERLIN, Aug 6 (Reuters) - A European Union measure to protect European companies from damage done by U.S. sanctions on Iran will take effect on Tuesday, the same day as sanctions are reintroduced, the German foreign minister said on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump decided on May 8 to revive Iran-related sanctions, including sanctions aimed at Iran's oil sector and transactions with its central bank. The EU wants to salvage the Iran nuclear deal, which provides the Islamic Republic relief from economic sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. Europe sees the deal as an important element of international security. ""The lifting of nuclear-related sanctions is an essential part of the deal,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a joint statement with the French and British foreign ministers. Maas said Germany, France and Britain deeply regretted the re-imposition of sanctions by the U.S. and the three countries were determined to protect European companies engaged in business with Iran using an updated version of the EU's so-called Blocking Statute. By updating the 1996 regulation - which bans any EU company from complying with U.S. sanctions and does not recognise any court rulings that enforce American penalties - the EU will protect European firms, the ministry said. The German Economy Ministry said the German government would continue to offer export and investment guarantees for firms doing business with Iran, adding Berlin remained in dialogue with the U.S. on exemptions for German companies. The update of the regulation will most likely ""come into effect on 7th August, coinciding with the reintroduction of the first U.S. secondary sanctions,"" the ministry told Reuters. WARNING TO THE U.S. The blocking regulation has never been used and is seen by European governments more as a political weapon than a regulation because its rules are vague and difficult to enforce, serving mainly as a warning to the United States. The regulation does not provide for any legal claim for damages by companies against the EU or EU member states if they are to be affected by the U.S. sanctions, the ministry said. But the claim would be directed against the ""initiator"" of the damage, meaning the U.S. in Iran case, it added. The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) said the announcement of U.S. sanctions against Iran was already reflected in current German export figures. ""Many companies are on the retreat in the face of U.S. sanctions against Iran,"" DIHK head Martin Wansleben said, adding that although business with Iran was still legal under EU law, new and ongoing banking transactions was no longer working. German exports to Iran fell by 4 percent in the first five months of 2018 after rising by 16 percent last year, he said. Dieter Kempf, head of Germany's BDI industry body, said: ""In order to create incentives to continue the agreement, payment transactions with Iran must be maintained in the first place."" Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives said although Iran's role in the region was problematic, reintroducing sanctions sent the wrong signal and would escalate tensions in the region. ""Preventing German companies that don't abide by U.S. sanctions from doing business with the U.S. contradicts international law and is not how you treat friends,"" Hardt said.

"PARIS, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Italy has formally asked France toextradite a former leftist militant believed to have been activeduring the country's so-called ""Years of Lead"", the Frenchministry of justice said. Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini last monthurged French President Emmanuel Macron to extradite leftistguerrillas who have been hiding in France for decades to avoidserving prison sentences in Italy. Hundreds of people were murdered in bombings, assassinationsand street warfare by rival far-right and far-left militantfactions during the ""Years of Lead"", a period of social andpolitical turmoil from the late 1960s to early 1980s. ""As of today, talks between the French and Italian Justiceministries are being held over 15 cases,"" a spokesman forFrance's justice ministry said late on Monday, adding Italy hadsent an official extradition request concerning one militantlast week. The spokesman said he was expecting a second request in thecoming days and that a meeting would take place on Wednesday todiscuss Italy's demands, but that no decision was expected then. There are nine Italian leftist fugitives living in France,according to Rome’s la Repubblica newspaper, including threeconvicted for playing a role in the 1978 kidnapping of formerItalian prime minister Aldo Moro. The request by Salvini, leader of the far-right Leagueparty, to Macron last month came after the return of communistmilitant Cesare Battisti to Italy from Bolivia to serve a lifesentence for his involvement in four murders in the late 1970s. Battisti escaped prison in 1981 and spent more than 15 yearsin France before fleeing to South America. Former French President Francois Mitterrand established whatcame to be known as the ""Mitterrand doctrine"" in the mid-1980s,a policy that shielded the militants from extradition becauseMitterrand said the Italian justice system was stacked againstthem. The doctrine was abandoned in the early 2000s.(Reporting by Emmanuel Jarry; Writing by Matthias Blamont;Editing by Richard Lough)",Italy presses France to extradite former leftist militant,"italy has formally asked france toextradite a former leftist militant believed to have been activeduring the country's so-called "" years of lead "" hundreds of people were murdered in bombings , assassinationsand street warfare by rival far-right and far-left militantfactions during the "" years of lead""",italy formally asks france to extradite former leftist militant -  french justice ministry
"(Updates to clarify Bolton comments based on U.S. government transcript) MOSCOW, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The United States has yet to decide if it will impose new sanctions on Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump's National Security Advisor John Bolton said on Wednesday, saying it was in the process of making a decision. Bolton made the comments at a news conference in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, according to a transcript of the event provided by the U.S. National Security Council. Earlier on Wednesday, Russia's Interfax news agency had incorrectly reported Bolton as saying that the United States was not currently considering imposing additional sanctions on Russia, sending the rouble higher. But the transcript showed Bolton had said that the matter was being actively considered in Washington. ""On the potential for additional sanctions on Russia, we are still considering what we may be obligated to do under a statute related to chemical weapons attacks,"" the transcript cited Bolton as saying. ""No decision has been made at this point, and I wouldnжt predict timing, whether it might be before the (U.S. mid-term)election or after the election. The decision-making is ongoing as we speak."" The U.S. State Department in August announced sanctions which targeted U.S. exports of sensitive national-security related goods to Russia after determining that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Britain, something Moscow denies. It said at the time it would consider imposing a second tranche of sanctions after 90 days if Moscow failed to provide ""reliable assurances"" it would no longer use chemical weapons and stopped blocking on-site inspections.

"Sept 14 (Reuters) - Tech analyst Mary Meeker is leaving venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers LLC to start her own firm, Kleiner said on Friday. It said Meeker was creating a separate firm with her colleagues Mood Rowghani, Noah Knauf and Juliet de Baubigy. Kleiner said the split, which was first reported by Recode, could be attributed to shifts in the funding ecosystem. Companies looking for early stage funding – the traditional focus at Kleiner Perkins – require larger checks and more specialized expertise, while fast-growing established companies, like Meeker investments Uber and Stripe, take more support. ""The changes in both areas have led to less overlap between venture and growth and creating two separate firms with different people and operations now makes sense,"" Kleiner spokeswoman Katie Hutchison said on Friday. She did not say when Meeker would leave. Meeker first became famous as Queen of the Net in the late 1990s, after a report she wrote for Morgan Stanley predicted the power and shape of the then still exotic World Wide Web. She joined Kleiner in 2010 and helps lead the venture capital firm’s digital growth funds. This would be a big shake up at the firm after its de-facto leader and prominent venture capitalists John Doerr stepped aside from his management role to become the firm's first chairman two year ago.

"GENEVA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Kofi Annan, the former United Nations Secretary-General and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who died on Saturday, will be remembered as a dedicated humanitarian whose career was tarnished by ugly conflicts that spun out of control. Annan was unable to bring peace to Syria and bring to rest the failures of diplomacy in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, Cyprus, Somalia and Iraq, which are likely to drown out the plaudits for his softly spoken mediation and efforts to eradicate poverty and AIDS that won him the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize. Annan was brought up in an ethnically divided culture in his native Ghana, but one where dialogue was prized and outright conflict rare. It was a time of optimism and confidence as Ghana headed for independence from Britain. ""He's driven by the idea of 'don't think no', always looking for the best outcome,"" Fred Eckhard, Annan's spokesman during his time as secretary-general, once told Reuters. His reputation as a mediator was burnished by his success in halting a spiralling conflict in Kenya in 2007, when rival claims to the presidency caused ethnic massacres in which more than 1,200 died. Annan put the rivals in a room and told them: ""There is only one Kenya"". He helped persuade one of them to accept the post of prime minister in a joint government. The violence ended. But earlier in his career, Annan's record was less successful. He was head of U.N. peacekeeping in 1994, when he acknowledges he should have done more to help prevent the slaughter of 800,000 Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The greatest reproach was that Annan failed to act on a telegram from the U.N. peacekeeper commander, General Romeo Dallaire, urging a move against arms caches being built up by Hutu extremists as they prepared mass murder. ""I believed at that time that I was doing my best,"" Annan said years later. ""But I realised after the genocide that there was more that I could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support."" In a book scathing about the world's failure to act, Dallaire had only praise for Annan, describing his ""humanism and dedication to the plight of others"". When his U.N. career ended in 2006, he listed his main achievements as establishing the concept of a responsibility to protect civilians when their rulers will not or cannot. But his tenure was littered with diplomatic disasters. BLOODSHED His worst moments, Annan said, included not being able to stop the bloodshed in Sudan's Darfur, the oil-for-food debacle and the Iraq war, after which he lost his voice for months. The oil-for-food scandal broke in early 2004 when it emerged that Saddam Hussein had cheated the $64-billion programme designed to relieve the pain of U.N. sanctions on the Iraqi people. The sanctions were imposed after Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait. While few U.N. officials were accused of enriching themselves, the world body was blamed for lax management and not blowing the whistle on Saddam's tactics. Although Annan was cleared of wrongdoing, his son Kojo was found to have used U.N. contacts to his improper advantage. Then came the most painful event - the bombing of U.N. headquarters in Baghdad on Aug. 19, 2003, that killed 22 people after Annan had decided, at the urging of the United States, to send senior U.N. staff back to Iraq, including his envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello, who was among the victims. ""It hit me almost as much as the loss of my twin sister,"" Annan told his last news conference as secretary-general, his voice choking. Efua Annan died of an illness in 1991. Annan was also at the helm at the time of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia, where insufficient U.N. peacekeeping forces again failed to stop the killing, and during a fiasco in Somalia that preceded Rwanda. His defenders say he tried to get enough troops and the big power support to make a difference in Bosnia and Rwanda. Critics argue that he was held back by respect for the limits he had learned in decades as a U.N. functionary. At an event in April to mark his 80th birthday, Annan was defensive about his role in Rwanda, joked wryly about being mistaken for actor Morgan Freeman after retiring, and decried a lack of strong leaders to help handle crises. ""We have had difficulties in the past but in some cases leadership has made a difference,"" he said, ending on an upbeat note: ""I am a stubborn optimist, I was born an optimist and will remain an optimist. The moment I lose hope all is lost, I encourage you to keep hope as well.""

"(Adds detail on bonds prices) By Adam Jourdan and Rodrigo Campos BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Argentina's presidential front-runner Alberto Fernandez said that if elected next month, he would aim to avoid haircuts on bond payments and seek a moderate ""Uruguay-style"" debt restructuring, music to the ears of the country's creditors. Investors are closely watching Fernandez's comments on debt after the South American nation was forced to announce plans to renegotiate around $100 billion in bonds after a sharp market crash in August pushed the country toward default. The Peronist candidate, who soundly beat market-friendly incumbent Mauricio Macri in an August primary, is the distant favorite to win the Oct. 27 general election. How his administration will handle the debt crisis is one of the key questions for the country and its local and global backers. ""Indebtedness it the biggest issues Argentina faces today,"" Fernandez said on Twitter late on Thursday, aiming criticism at Macri's administration for taking on too much debt. ""(But) we never said we wouldn't pay or that there would be a haircut."" He added that the country - in recession for much of the last year - needed to return to growth and to bolster exports to be able to meet its obligations. ""We will pay the debts by growing and exporting... The only way is to export. The other channel has been exhausted, which is to borrow,"" he said, adding that the country needed time to ""defer"" its debts to ensure it could pay them in full. In separate comments at an event in Cordoba, he said Argentina should be able to replicate the model of neighboring Uruguay, which successfully undertook voluntary debt renegotiations in 2003 and is widely seen as a positive model. Credit Suisse said in a note on Friday that Fernandez's comments were good news for the country's creditors. The country's over-the-counter bonds were up an average of 1% by early afternoon local time, traders said. Argentina's century bond traded up nearly one cent at 43.15 cents on the dollar according to MarketAxess data, while the January 2028 benchmark rose more than a cent to trade at 41.15 cents, both on small volume. ""We think that Fernandez's remarks regarding paying debt without a haircut, along with his track record, suggest that he could pursue a moderate economic policy course if elected,"" the investment bank said. The bank added, though, that how Fernandez would achieve his goals of spurring growth while maintaining fiscal discipline under a $57 billion credit facility struck with the International Monetary Fund last year remained ""unclear."" Roger Horn, senior emerging market strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities America in New York, said most investors expected some sort of losses, so they would welcome Fernandez' comments. Ratings agencies like Fitch and Moody's have also factored in write-downs on local and dollar debt. ""Hearing Fernandez refer to a Uruguay-style re-profiling is a very positive thing,"" Horn told Reuters. ""It at least shows a market-friendly intention.""

"By Alasdair Reilly, Claire Ruckin and Prudence Ho LONDON, April 1 (LPC) - Syndicated lending in Europe, the Middle East and Africa totalled US$144bn in the first three months of 2020, the lowest volume recorded for any quarter for a decade, as many borrowers are left reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Volume was nearly 40% lower in the first quarter than the US$239bn a year earlier, according to Refinitiv LPC data, as the virus took a grip, leaving much of Europe in a state of lock-down. Companies in beleaguered sectors such as leisure, travel and tourism are in survival mode while many other businesses are unable to operate normally. “We are still underwriting deals, but we are being more circumspect,” a senior banker said. “Things may change and there are a lot of unknowns, but at the moment everyone is keeping calm, being prudent while continuing to support clients.” Although many companies are scrambling to put liquidity in place to mitigate the effects of the pandemic, refinancing volume still sunk 43% to US$101bn in the first quarter, down from US$177bn in the first quarter of 2019. Europe's largest first quarter syndicated loan was for natural resource company Glencore, which has just completed its annual refinancing and extension for US$14.6bn. Global commodity trader Trafigura also completed its US$5.53bn flagship European multicurrency revolving credit facility in March. Before the virus struck, both Libor transition and sustainable lending were expected to be a prime focus for the loan market in 2020. British American Tobacco completed a £6bn (US$7.42bn) RCF that features a margin that will switch away from Libor to risk-free rates Sofr and Sonia when they become available. Meanwhile, Danish container logistics company AP Moeller-Maersk signed a US$5bn sustainability-linked RCF in March with a margin linked to the company’s progress in meeting its target of reducing CO2 emissions per cargo moved by 60% by 2030. With many companies now focused on cutting costs, and preserving cash and liquidity, acquisition activity has been firmly placed on the back burner. In addition, with stock markets wobbling across the board, sellers see little value in putting units up for sale. M&A lending dipped 49% to just US$27bn in the first quarter, down from US$52.4bn in the first quarter of 2019 as the pandemic took hold across the region. A few sizeable M&A loans were seen earlier in the year. Swiss stock exchange operator and financial infrastructure group SIX backed its all-cash offer for Spanish stock exchange operator Bolsas y Mercados Espanoles with a €2.79bn bridge loan that was syndicated in January. Meanwhile, UK aerospace and defence group BAE Systems backed its acquisition of Collins Aerospace's military global positioning system business with a US$1.925bn bridge loan from a group of five banks in January. HOPES DASHED The pandemic also had a negative effect on borrowing activity in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where volume of US$29.5bn was the lowest first quarter total for three years. Prior to the spread of the coronavirus reaching those regions, there had been optimism that one of CEEMEA's biggest loan markets, Russia, was beginning to show signs of recovery. Russian corporates have effectively been shut out of the international loan market since sanctions were imposed by the West in 2014 in response to Moscow's annexation of Crimea. It was anticipated that nickel and palladium producer Norilsk Nickel's landmark US$4.15bn loan would be the first of a growing number of loans for Russian borrowers, although the pandemic has now put those hopes on hold. Norilsk's five-year facility was the largest and cheapest unsecured syndicated loan for a Russian corporate since sanctions were introduced and the deal helped boost Russian loan volume to US$5.63bn in the first quarter, making it the largest quarterly total since Q2 2016. LEVERAGED LOSS Europe’s leveraged loan market had a robust start to 2020 but as the coronavirus crisis hit the market it dampened any hopes of a strong quarter and compressed volumes to US$40.11bn, the lowest level since 2016. 2020 kicked off with high expectations following the UK general election and more certainty in terms of Brexit. Lending in January and February reached US$35.16bn, accounting for 88% of first quarter leveraged volume, according to LPC data. There was a mix of event-driven financings, including a £1.082bn-equivalent loan to back Cinven and Astorg’s buyout of UK life sciences group LGC, and opportunistic loans as borrowers took advantage of positive market conditions and plenty of money to reprice and refinance loans on more attractive terms. Those conditions allowed an excess €650m of loans backing Advent International’s buyout of German chemicals group Evonik’s methacrylates plastics unit to finally be sold at the beginning of February, bringing an end to a long-running saga that had seen a first syndication process close in June 2019 when the banks were left holding the overhang. However, the market was almost shut in March due to volatile market sentiment caused by coronavirus and volume was a mere US$4.95bn. A number of borrowers postponed financings in March including a €1.61bn acquisition loan by Dutch equipment rental firm Boels; a €1.5bn financing backing Lonestar’s acquisition of BASF’s construction chemicals business; a €520m leveraged loan for Ardian’s acquisition of Cerelia, a French company that makes pizza dough and cookies; a €274.7m acquisition loan by French laboratory services group Biogroup LCD; and a US$1.435bn-equivalent refinancing loan by UK software company Micro Focus. “Event driven financings aren’t happening because events aren’t happening, no one is launching new deals. This is a significant event and people need to work out how to adjust to the new abnormal,” a syndicate head said. While the market initially thought 2020 would be a year of four strong quarters, it is expected that any activity in any meaningful size won’t get going until the third quarter at least. “Nothing is happening in the Single B loan space until at least the third quarter, if not the fourth,” a second syndicate head said. When the market does reopen there will be a number of deals to re-energise the market, including those that were postponed as well as an up to €11bn loan and bond financing to back Cinven and Germany's RAG Foundation’s €17.2bn acquisition of Thyssenkrupp’s elevators division. Deutsche Bank led the EMEA syndicated loan bookrunner league table at the end of the first quarter with a US$7.74bn market share and 30 deals. UniCredit was second with US$6.19bn and 29 deals, while Bank of America was third with a US$6.10bn market share and 21 deals.

" (Repeats story for wider distribution, no changes to text)    * Industrials shine with 5 percent positive surprise    * Companies cite China as a positive rather than a negative    * Technology and healthcare also showing strength    * Companies point to second half rebound    By Helen Reid and Thyagaraju Adinarayan    LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - European investors breathed a sighof relief as more than half the region's major companiesreported first-quarter earnings above market expectations, evenif the bar was set very low ahead of results season,underscoring hopes the worst is behind Europe Inc.    As the mid-way mark of the Q1 reporting season approaches,companies' stronger performance and the diminishing mentions ofrisks related to China and a global trade war are encouragingsigns.    Make no mistake: European earnings overall are stillpredicted to shrink by 4.2 percent from a year ago, the worstshowing since the third quarter of 2016.    But numbers for the pan-European STOXX 600 companies havebeen better than feared: some 58 percent of them beatexpectations, compared to a long-term average of 50 percent andtracking its best quarter in two years, Refinitiv data showed.     Industrials, a sector very closely geared to European andglobal economic growth, have been a success with earningsdelivering a 5 percent surprise.     The sector is also one of the furthest along in reportingwith more than 40 percent of companies' results through.    The data also showed Swedish truck maker Volvo,engineering group Alfa Laval and Airbustopped the charts in terms of positive surprises, whileLufthansa had the biggest negative surprise.    That spells a much stronger performance than diremanufacturing data would suggest. Euro zone factory activitycontracted for a third month in April.    Technology and healthcare also contributed to a highernumber of beats in the March quarter, although only about adozen companies from each of those sectors have reported so far.    SAP, Europe's biggest tech company, reportedrobust results and raised its outlook, helping the shares soar12.5 percent.    A stellar sales increase at Sanofi's rare diseasesGenzyme unit boosted the French drug maker's shares.    With ""short European equities"" cited as the most crowdedtrade globally for two consecutive months in Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch's (BAML) fund manager survey, it's clear manyinvestors think negativity on the region may be close to a peak.    ""Consensus suggests the region is significantly challenged,but it has performed better than many realise,"" said GrahamSecker, head of European equity strategy at Morgan Stanley.    Europe's STOXX 600 has outperformed even the mainemerging markets benchmark year-to-date.    https://tmsnrt.rs/2Wh07sN       MANAGING EXPECTATIONS    But this may not be reason enough to rejoice just yet.    It is a reflection, partly, of companies in Europe becomingmore savvy with their guidance and managing expectations aheadof results.     Investors have thus been cautious about extrapolating thisto a stronger underlying economy. There has however been amarked shift in the pressure points for companies.     China was mentioned as a positive driver much more than anegative, according to BAML strategists, a sign massive stimulusin the world's second biggest economy may have had an impact.    Luxury group LVMH said demand had picked up inmainland China, boosting its first-quarter sales and driving itsshares up nearly 5 percent to a record high.    Britain's pending exit from the European Union and theU.S.-China trade war were also blamed less often for poorperformance.     Another area of improvement has been the frequency of cutsto profit forecasts: so far this quarter has seen the fewestprofit warnings at the start of earnings season in a year.     ""The number of profit warnings (so far) is well below thatof the past earnings seasons, which should be seen as a positivedevelopment,"" said Stephane Ekolo, an equity strategist atTradition.       DELAYED GRATIFICATION    Companies across sectors have guided investors to a strongersecond half.    Earnings growth expectations, having already fallensignificantly, should stabilise at this level, said EmmanuelCau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays.     ""The bulk of the EPS downgrades is behind us and (we) expectearnings momentum to improve as we move into H2,"" he said.    After a blistering start to the year for global stocks,investors are finding it hard to make head or tail of a rallythat caught many by surprise as they recovered from a harshsell-off late last year.    Mixed economic signals do not help paint a clearer picture.    Stronger earnings from industrial companies fly in the faceof data points like euro zone industry sentiment, which fell fora fifth consecutive month in March and was well below marketexpectations.    But better reports from the companies most sensitive togrowth could be an early sign of a pick-up in activity.    ""The recession might have been priced out but the recoveryhas not yet been priced in,"" said Andrew Milligan, head ofglobal strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.     Still, Milligan stopped short of outright positivity onEurope, saying the possibility of an escalation in a tradedispute with the United States is part of his decision to stickwith a neutral position in his global portfolio.    Politics aside, the holy grail for investors in Europeremains economic improvement - and that could still be a whileaway.    ""Is Europe going to be a top pick? Only if we start to seesome very definite signs that the European economy is turningand turning up very sizeably. We're just not seeing that,"" addedMilligan.

"* Shares drop as shorter work hours extended * VAT says market correction continues * Analysts fear 2019 could get worse(Adds details, company comment, analyst comment) By John Miller ZURICH, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Weak demand from semiconductorcustomers forced Swiss vacuum valve maker VAT Group tokeep 400 production employees on shorter working hours as itseeks to manage a prolonged market slump without sheddingtrained staff. VAT shares fell 5.9 percent after Wednesday's announcement,extending a decline this year to about 38 percent. When the semiconductor industry boomed in 2017, the Swisscompany's shares rose more than 70 percent and were among thenation's top stock market performers. VAT, whose vacuum valves are critical components in chipfactories, is seen as a bellwether for the industry. Itsannouncement in October that its Swiss workers would workshorter hours added to a correction among semiconductor stocks. The company said on Wednesday the business slowdown wascontinuing, forcing it to keep down hours for employees at itsfacility in Haag, Switzerland for longer than expected. Thelatest cut in hours is planned until March 31. ""VAT is confronted with a market correction due to thesignificant capacity additions by the semiconductor companiesduring 2017 and the beginning of 2018 that need to be digested,""the company said in a statement. It said semiconductor and display activities were sufferingfrom delays in expansion plans at fabrication plants. VAT, which also has production in Romania and Malaysia, saidin 2017 it had boosted its market share of vacuum valves andrelated products for semiconductors and display manufacturing to45 percent, a rise of 4 percent. This year, the company reported lower-than-expected thirdquarter orders as it revised down its 2018 outlook.

"(Adds background, details on legalization efforts in otherstates) By Matthew Lavietes NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - New York state on Mondaydecriminalized recreational marijuana use, meaning possession ofsmall amounts of the drug will be punished with fines ratherthan jail time, a step short of Governor Andrew Cuomo's goal oflegalizing pot. Cuomo said the measure would also allow a mechanism forclearing the records of people who had been criminally convictedof possessing small amounts of marijuana. Eleven U.S. states plus the District of Columbia have fullylegalized recreational marijuana use since Colorado first did soin 2014, according to the Marijuana Policy Project lobbyinggroup. Another 15 states including New York have decriminalizedit. ""By providing individuals who have suffered the consequencesof an unfair marijuana conviction with a path to have theirrecords expunged and by reducing draconian penalties, we aretaking a critical step forward in addressing a broken anddiscriminatory criminal justice process,"" said Cuomo. The Democratic governor said in December that legalizingrecreational marijuana use was one of his top legislativepriorities for 2019. He argued that revenue from taxing the drugcould help address a number of needs, including New York City'stroubled subway system, which is desperately in need of majorrepairs and upgrades. A state report at the time estimated thelegal market for marijuana at between $1.7 billion and $3.5billion annually. New York lawmakers' efforts to legalize marijuana collapsedin June amid disagreement among Democrats on how to regulate theindustry, prompting the introduction of the decriminalizationbill. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law. During theadministration of former President Barack Obama, the U.S.government largely permitted states to determine how to handlethe issue on their own, but the Justice Department underPresident Donald Trump has allowed prosecutors to enforcefederal law even in states where marijuana is legal.

Both countries had insisted it was Libya's responsibility totake in the boat, Sea Eye said earlier in the week. The Maltese government said that through the coordination ofthe European Commission, the migrants will be redistributedamong Germany, France, Portugal and Luxembourg. ""None of the migrants will remain in Malta. The ship AlanKurdi will not be allowed to enter Malta,"" the government said. ""Once again the smallest member of the European Union wasput under unnecessary pressure, being asked to resolve a casewhich was neither its responsibility nor its remit,"" thegovernment added. ""A solution was found in order not to let the situationdeteriorate further while making it clear Malta cannot keepshouldering this burden."" In March, Malta received 108 migrants after the small tankerwhich rescued them was hijacked by some of the migrantsthemselves. Maltese soldiers stormed the vessel and escorted itto Malta.

"COPENHAGEN, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Freight-forwarder DSV Panalpina said on Friday it would start direct cargo flights between Shanghai and Huntsville, Alabama from next week to cope with capacity constraints caused by the coronavirus outbreak in China. The global freight industry has been hard-hit by uncertain demand and crews' health concerns following the outbreak of the deadly virus in China, leading airlines and freight firms to scale back services, causing delivery delays and mounting backlogs. Starting on Feb. 25, DSV plans to operate flights between Shanghai and Huntsville thrice weekly using the firm's Boeing 747-8 freighter plane, it said in a statement. ""Due to the risk of spreading of the coronavirus (COVID-19), multiple airlines have either suspended or reduced the number of flights to and from mainland China,"" it said. Crew on DSV's plane would rest in South Korea before flying to Shanghai and would virtually not disembark the plane while in Shanghai before returning to the United States with cargo. ""By doing it this way we can safely have this setup,"" Flemming Nielsen, executive vice president, told Reuters. Last week DSV said the coronavirus was squeezing air and sea freight capacity, but that it was still possible to ship goods on airplanes to countries neighbouring China and fly them out from there. DSV said it estimates capacity has shrunk by 5,000 tons a day due to the suspension of flights to China.

"(Adds TV) TOKYO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp unveiled a completely redesigned hydrogen-powered fuel cell sedan on Friday in its latest attempt to revive demand for the niche technology that it hopes will become mainstream. Japan's biggest automaker has been developing fuel-cell vehicles for more than two decades, but the technology has been eclipsed by the rapid rise of rival battery-powered electric vehicles promoted by the likes of Tesla Inc. Ahead of the Tokyo Motor Show starting on Oct. 24, Toyota unveiled a prototype of the new hydrogen sedan built on the same platform as its luxury Lexus brand's LS coupe. The new Mirai model boasts longer driving range than its predecessor and completely redesigned fuel cell stack and hydrogen tanks, the company said. ""We wanted to make a car that people really want to buy, not just because it's an eco car,"" Yoshikazu Tanaka, chief engineer of the new Mirai, said at the unveiling. ""We wanted something that's fun to drive."" Its sporty redesign with longer wheelbase and lower-slung chassis is a marked departure from the first-generation Mirai, which looks like a bulked-up Prius hybrid. The new car also has a 30% improvement in driving range over the previous iteration's approximately 700 kilometers (435 miles), according to the company. Tanaka said the latest Mirai would cost less to make than its predecessor, because of a shift to mass production. The current model is mostly assembled by hand. Costing consumers about 5 million yen ($46,500) after subsidies in Japan, the original Mirai is one of three fuel cell cars available to consumers. Hyundai Motor Co sells the Nexo, while Honda Motor Co Ltd leases out the Clarity. Toyota has sold fewer than 10,000 of the Mirai, a fuel cell sedan it touted as a game changer at its launch five years ago. By contrast, Tesla sold 25,000 of battery-powered Model S sedans in its first year and a half. Toyota declined to disclose a price for the model and said it would be available from late next year in Japan, North America and Europe.

Brooks Koepka locked up the $2 million Wyndham Rewards firstprize with his St. Jude win on Sunday. Paul Casey, who at number eight on the FedEx Cup/WyndhamRewards points list is the highest-ranked player in action thisweek, said he understood why most of his peers opted to skip thetournament ahead of the three-event FedEx Cup playoffs. ""I would like to have seen more players here but ... theultimate prize we're trying to win (is) the FedEx Cup,"" theEnglishman said at Sedgefield Country Club on Wednesday. ""Guys are doing whatever is necessary to get themselves inthe perfect position for that. I thought probably one or twoguys would be here but I can't answer for them, and Ishouldn't."" A win on Sunday and would lift Casey from eighth to fourthin the Wyndham standings and would also earn him a $1.1 millionbonus. But considering he would have played six weeks in a row bytime the Tour Championship rolls around late next month, Caseyadmitted that the situation was not ideal. ""It's a challenge,"" said Casey, who thinks he has only fouror five years left to realistically challenge at the top level. ""I'm 42, so it's not great ... but I love playing golf sowhy not take this opportunity. ""The form I've got and my opportunities are not going to bethere forever. I'm one of only a handful of guys who's stilldoing this at this level in the 40s."" The field is not completely devoid of star power. Three-times major winner Jordan Spieth will be in action ashe tries to play his way back into form. The American is 67th onthe FedEx Cup points list after a sporadic campaign. World No. 17 Webb Simpson and No. 24 Patrick Reed are alsoplaying. Reed and Spieth had a magnificent duel here six years ago,when the former won a playoff after threading a miracle shotthrough the trees to set up birdie at the first extra hole.

"* Coke futures jump as much as 3.6 pct, iron ore down * China's anti-smog fight limits coke production * Coal hub Shanxi starts inspections on diesel trucks By Manolo Serapio Jr MANILA, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Chinese coke futures surged almost 4 percent to a seven-year high on Friday, adding to sharp gains in the prior session, as environmental restrictions capped supply of the steelmaking ingredient. China's major coal mining hub, Shanxi province, which produced a fifth of the country's total coke output last year, began this week inspecting emissions of diesel-fuelled trucks and vehicles. Many of these trucks carry coal and coke from Shanxi to major ports in northern China. The rally in coke - the processed form of coking coal - followed a recent surge in steel prices to six-year peaks. China's smog war has seen its cities restricting industrial production this year, including of steel and coke, ahead of tighter curbs this winter. The most actively traded coke for January delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange rose as much as 3.6 percent to 2,614.50 yuan ($380) a tonne, the highest since July 2011. It was up 3.1 percent at 2,602.50 yuan by 0222 GMT. ""All market participants have increased their coke prices because of the environmental restrictions by the government,"" said a coke trader in Tianjin. Coking coal futures were up 1 percent at 1,272.50 yuan a tonne, after initially hitting 1,294 yuan, a one-week high. Construction steel product rebar on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 0.8 percent to 4,171 yuan per tonne. Iron ore was the day's underperformer in the ferrous complex, with the most active Dalian contract slipping 0.7 percent to 493 yuan. Iron ore remains in high supply in China as imports rose 8 percent from June to 89.96 million tonnes in July despite the steel production limits. At China's ports, stocks of iron ore stood at 154.3 million tonnes last week versus a record 161.98 million tonnes in June, based on data compiled by SteelHome consultancy. <SH-TOT-IRONINV> Spot iron ore for delivery to China's Qingdao port <.IO62-CNO=MB> dropped 1 percent to $66.51 a tonne on Thursday, falling for a fifth day to the lowest since July 26, according to Metal Bulletin.

"(Adds minister apologising for comment on foreign workers) VALLETTA, March 18 (Reuters) - Malta will stop all incoming passenger flights on Saturday and only allow cargo, humanitarian and repatriation flights to land to stop the spread of coronavirus, officials said on Wednesday. The Mediterranean island, which depends heavily on tourism, has reported 38 cases so far, of which 32 were people who had caught the disease abroad. ""Saturday will be a dark day for the local aviation industry and all stakeholders who have worked tirelessly to ensure the industry's growth and success over the past years,"" Malta International Airport CEO Alan Borg said in a statement. ""Now, more than ever, it is crucial for us to work together with government and all industry players to see the local aviation industry through these trying times."" The spread of the virus and international restrictions on travel have severely hit the island's economy. Tourism accounts for a quarter of its gross domestic product, and its financial services and gaming sectors rely heavily on foreign workers. The Times of Malta newspaper said on Wednesday that experts have warned the government that the economy, the best performing in the EU, could shrink by up to half over the next year. Economy Minister Silvio Schembri prompted outrage on social media late Tuesday when he told parliament that foreign workers who lose their jobs should go back to their countries. ""Charity begins at home. Our focus is workers from Malta and Gozo. The moment foreign workers lose jobs they will have to go back to their country,"" the minister said. Gozo is a small island that is part of the Maltese archipelago. Schembri apologised on Wednesday for his comments and promised that anyone who had had a legal work contract would not be deported. ""We are committed to assisting employers, employees and the self-employed in these difficult days, which I am certain we will overcome together,"" he said.
